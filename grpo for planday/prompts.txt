# SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a precise event scheduler.
1. First, reason through the problem inside <think> and </think> tags. Here you can create drafts, compare alternatives, and check for mistakes.
2. When confident, output the final schedule inside <schedule> and </schedule> tags. Your schedule must strictly follow the rules provided by the user."""

# USER PROMPT

Task: create an optimized schedule based on the given events.

Rules:
- The schedule MUST be in strict chronological order. Do NOT place priority events earlier unless their actual start time is earlier.
- Event start and end times are ABSOLUTE. NEVER change, shorten, adjust, or split them.
- Priority events (weight = 2) carry more weight than normal events (weight = 1), but they MUST still respect chronological order.
- Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
- No overlaps allowed. In conflicts, include the event with the higher weighted time.
- Some events may be excluded if needed to meet these rules.


You must use this format:  

<think>...</think>
<schedule>
<event>
<name>...</name>
<start>...</start>
<end>...</end>
</event>
...
</schedule>
