Event Scheduling Dataset Generator

This module generates synthetic event scheduling problems with the following characteristics:
- Random number of events (4-8) with varying durations
- Events can overlap with a controlled probability
- Some events are marked as priority events
- Each problem includes an optimal score calculation
