To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, I'll first identify the critical events and then arrange them according to their start times and weights. 

The events and their priorities are:
1. Reading 'Dune' (01:44 - 03:29) - Weight = 1
2. Calling Mom and Dad (11:59 - 13:44) - Weight = 2
3. Shopping at farmer's market (15:33 - 16:48) - Weight = 1
4. Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:57 - 16:42) - Weight = 2
5. Planting flowers in the garden (18:30 - 20:30) - Weight = 1
6. Walking with Bella (21:40 - 23:25) - Weight = 1

Given the priorities, I need to ensure that "Calling Mom and Dad" and "Deep cleaning the kitchen" are included in the schedule if possible without conflict.

Let's start with the earliest events:

1. **Reading 'Dune'** (01:44 - 03:29) - This event starts early and has a lower weight, so it should be included.

2. **Calling Mom and Dad** (11:59 - 13:44) - This event has a high priority and should be included as soon as possible.

3. **Shopping at farmer's market** (15:33 - 16:48) - This event has a lower weight and fits after the higher-priority events.

4. **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (15:57 - 16:42) - This event also has a high priority and conflicts with the shopping event. Since it has a higher weight, we will exclude the shopping event and include this one instead.

5. **Planting flowers in the garden** (18:30 - 20:30) - This event has a lower weight and can fit after the deep cleaning event.

6. **Walking with Bella** (21:40 - 23:25) - This event has a lower weight and can fit last.

Thus, the optimized schedule will be:
