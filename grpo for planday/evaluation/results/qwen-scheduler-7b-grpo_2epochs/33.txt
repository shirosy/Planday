To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate each event:

1. **Reading 'Dune' (04:18 - 04:48)** - Weight = 2
2. **Planting flowers in the garden (06:06 - 06:51)** - Weight = 1
3. **Cooking pasta (15:25 - 15:55)** - Weight = 2
4. **Calling Mom and Dad (15:37 - 17:07)** - Weight = 1
5. **Walking with Bella (16:39 - 18:09)** - Weight = 1
6. **Yoga class with Emily (18:26 - 19:26)** - Weight = 1
7. **Jogging at the park (19:55 - 21:55)** - Weight = 1
8. **Watching 'Inception' (21:32 - 22:02)** - Weight = 1

Given the priorities and the fact that some events overlap, we need to exclude lower-weighted events when necessary to maintain the maximum sum of weighted event durations.

### Step-by-Step Schedule Optimization:

1. **Reading 'Dune'** (04:18 - 04:48) - Weight = 2
   - This is a high-priority event and should be included.

2. **Planting flowers in the garden** (06:06 - 06:51) - Weight = 1
   - This can be included as it doesn't conflict with any other event.

3. **Cooking pasta** (15:25 - 15:55) - Weight = 2
   - This is another high-priority event and should be included.

4. **Calling Mom and Dad** (15:37 - 17:07) - Weight = 1
   - This conflicts with **Cooking pasta** (15:25 - 15:55). Since **Cooking pasta** has higher weight, **Calling Mom and Dad** cannot be included.

5. **Walking with Bella** (16:39 - 18:09) - Weight = 1
   - This conflicts with **Yoga class with Emily** (18:26 - 19:26). Since **Yoga class with Emily** has higher weight, **Walking with Bella** cannot be included.

6. **Yoga class with Emily** (18:26 - 19:26) - Weight = 1
   - This is a low-priority event and conflicts with **Walking with Bella**, so it can be included.

7. **Jogging at the park** (19:55 - 21:55) - Weight = 1
   - This can be included as it doesn't conflict with any other event.

8. **Watching 'Inception'** (21:32 - 22:02) - Weight = 1
   - This can be included as it doesn't conflict with any other event.
