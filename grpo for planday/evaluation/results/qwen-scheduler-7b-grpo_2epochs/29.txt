To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints and prioritizes the specified events, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the events and their weights.
2. Ensure no overlapping events by comparing start and end times.
3. Prioritize the events as specified.
4. Adjust the schedule if necessary to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the rules.

Given events:
- Cooking pasta (02:02 - 03:02)
- Yoga class with Emily (08:12 - 08:57)
- Walking with Bella (15:57 - 17:12)
- Calling Mom and Dad (17:35 - 19:35)
- Planting flowers in the garden (18:55 - 19:40)
- Reading 'Dune' (20:58 - 22:43)

Priorities:
- Calling Mom and Dad (weight = 2)
- Reading 'Dune' (weight = 2)

Let's evaluate the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Cooking pasta (02:02 - 03:02)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
2. **Yoga class with Emily (08:12 - 08:57)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
3. **Walking with Bella (15:57 - 17:12)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
4. **Calling Mom and Dad (17:35 - 19:35)**: Priority event (weight = 2)
5. **Planting flowers in the garden (18:55 - 19:40)**: Overlaps with Calling Mom and Dad (17:35 - 19:35). We need to exclude it.
6. **Reading 'Dune' (20:58 - 22:43)**: Priority event (weight = 2)

Now, let's construct the schedule:

- **Cooking pasta (02:02 - 03:02)** (weight = 1)
- **Yoga class with Emily (08:12 - 08:57)** (weight = 1)
- **Walking with Bella (15:57 - 17:12)** (weight = 1)
- **Calling Mom and Dad (17:35 - 19:35)** (weight = 2)
- **Reading 'Dune' (20:58 - 22:43)** (weight = 2)

The total weighted duration is calculated as follows:
- Cooking pasta: 1 * 60 minutes = 60 minutes
- Yoga class with Emily: 1 * 45 minutes = 45 minutes
- Walking with Bella: 1 * 75 minutes = 75 minutes
- Calling Mom and Dad: 2 * 60 minutes = 120 minutes
- Reading 'Dune': 2 * 85 minutes = 170 minutes

Total weighted duration: 60 + 45 + 75 + 120 + 170 = 470 minutes

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the given rules.
