To create an optimized schedule, I need to consider the constraints and prioritize the events according to their start times and weights. The Sum 41 concert has the highest priority, so it should be scheduled first if possible without conflict.

1. **David Bowie tribute concert (03:15 - 03:30)**: This event is at the beginning and cannot be moved.
2. **Sum 41 concert (12:56 - 14:41)**: This event has high priority and should be included.
3. **Jam session (21:44 - 21:59)**: This event conflicts with the David Guetta DJ set (21:54 - 23:24). Since the Jam session ends before the DJ set starts, it can be included.
4. **David Guetta DJ set (21:54 - 23:24)**: This event conflicts with the Jam session. However, since the Jam session ends before the DJ set starts, the DJ set will take precedence due to its higher priority.

Given these considerations, the Sum 41 concert and the Jam session can both be included, but the David Bowie tribute concert and the David Guetta DJ set cannot both be included due to overlap. We need to choose the one that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.

- Including David Bowie tribute concert (weight = 1): Duration = 15 minutes
- Including Sum 41 concert (weight = 2): Duration = 35 minutes
- Including Jam session (weight = 1): Duration = 15 minutes
- Including David Guetta DJ set (weight = 2): Duration = 75 minutes

The maximum sum of weighted event durations is achieved by including the David Bowie tribute concert, Sum 41 concert, and David Guetta DJ set.
