To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, let's evaluate the events and prioritize them according to the given rules:

1. **David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
2. **Silent disco party (11:50 - 13:05)**: Priority event (weight = 2)
3. **David Bowie tribute concert (12:17 - 12:32)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
4. **Avril Lavigne concert (14:39 - 15:54)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
5. **Sum 41 concert (15:52 - 16:22)**: Priority event (weight = 2)

Given the priorities and no overlap rule, we need to decide how to handle conflicts. Since the Silent disco party has a higher weight than the David Bowie tribute concert, it should take precedence over the latter. Similarly, the Sum 41 concert has a higher weight than the Avril Lavigne concert, so it should take precedence over the latter.

Let's construct the schedule step-by-step:

1. Start with the David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40).
2. Add the Silent disco party (11:50 - 13:05) as it has a higher priority.
3. The David Bowie tribute concert (12:17 - 12:32) conflicts with the Silent disco party, so it cannot be included.
4. Add the Sum 41 concert (15:52 - 16:22) as it has a higher priority.
5. The Avril Lavigne concert (14:39 - 15:54) conflicts with the Sum 41 concert, so it cannot be included.

Final Schedule:
- David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40)
- Silent disco party (11:50 - 13:05)
- Sum 41 concert (15:52 - 16:22)
