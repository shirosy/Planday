To create an optimized schedule that respects the given rules and prioritizes "Watching 'Inception'", I'll analyze the events and their constraints step-by-step:

1. **Event Durations**:
   - Watching 'Inception': 01:29 - 02:44 (65 minutes)
   - Calling Mom and Dad: 02:02 - 02:17 (15 minutes)
   - Walking with Bella: 10:15 - 12:15 (120 minutes)
   - Yoga class with Emily: 13:37 - 15:07 (80 minutes)

2. **Priority**:
   - "Watching 'Inception'" has a weight of 2, making it a priority event.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Priority events must not be moved earlier than their actual start time.
   - Overlaps between events are not allowed, and the event with higher weight should be included in case of conflict.
   - We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Given these constraints, let's arrange the events:

- "Watching 'Inception'" starts at 01:29 and ends at 02:44. This event cannot be moved.
- "Calling Mom and Dad" from 02:02 to 02:17 overlaps with "Watching 'Inception'". Since "Watching 'Inception'" is a priority event, we must keep it as is. Therefore, "Calling Mom and Dad" will not be included in the schedule.
- "Walking with Bella" starts at 10:15 and ends at 12:15. This event does not overlap with any other event.
- "Yoga class with Emily" starts at 13:37 and ends at 15:07. This event does not overlap with any other event.

By following these steps, we ensure that "Watching 'Inception'" is included as a priority event, and no overlapping events are present.
