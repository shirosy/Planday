To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to ensure that the priority event (Fireworks) is included at its specified time. We also need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Backstage tour VIP pass**: This event starts at 03:05 and ends at 03:50. It has a weight of 1.
2. **David Guetta DJ set**: This event starts at 03:15 and ends at 03:30. It has a weight of 1.
3. **Fireworks**: This event starts at 10:30 and ends at 11:30. It has a weight of 2 (priority).
4. **David Bowie tribute concert**: This event starts at 15:42 and ends at 16:12. It has a weight of 1.

Since the Fireworks event is a priority and must be included at its specified time from 10:30 to 11:30, it will occupy the slot from 10:30 to 11:30. 

Now, let's consider the other events:
- The Backstage tour VIP pass and David Guetta DJ set both have the same start time of 03:15. Since they have the same weight and cannot overlap, one of them must be excluded. Given that the Backstage tour VIP pass is a shorter event (03:05 - 03:50), it should be excluded to make room for another event.
- The David Bowie tribute concert does not conflict with the Fireworks event, so it can be included as it is.

Thus, the optimized schedule will include:
- David Guetta DJ set (03:15 - 03:30)
- Fireworks (10:30 - 11:30)
- David Bowie tribute concert (15:42 - 16:12)

This schedule respects the priority of the Fireworks event and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
