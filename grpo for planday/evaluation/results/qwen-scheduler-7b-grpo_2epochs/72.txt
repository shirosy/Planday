To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, I'll first identify the key points:

1. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 05:02 - 07:02 (Weight = 1)
2. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 11:21 - 12:51 (Weight = 2)
3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 14:44 - 15:14 (Weight = 1)
4. **Chess with Daniel**: 18:24 - 19:09 (Weight = 1)
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 21:20 - 22:05 (Weight = 1)
6. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 21:35 - 22:20 (Weight = 1)

The quantum computing guest talk has a higher priority (weight = 2). Therefore, it should not be moved or conflicted with other events. 

Let's analyze the potential conflicts:
- The study session with Sarah and Mike (14:44 - 15:14) does not conflict with any other event.
- Chess with Daniel (18:24 - 19:09) does not conflict with any other event.
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:20 - 22:05) conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture (21:35 - 22:20).

Since the Structural Dynamics lecture has a lower weight (weight = 1) compared to the quantum computing guest talk (weight = 2), we will exclude the Structural Dynamics lecture to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 05:02 - 07:02
2. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 11:21 - 12:51
3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 14:44 - 15:14
4. **Chess with Daniel**: 18:24 - 19:09
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 21:20 - 22:05

This schedule respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
