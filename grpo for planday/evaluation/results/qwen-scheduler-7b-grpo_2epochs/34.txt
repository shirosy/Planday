The task requires us to create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints. Let's analyze the events and priorities:

1. **Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)** - Priority event (weight = 2).
2. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (03:39 - 05:39)** - Normal event (weight = 1).
3. **Cooking pasta (12:06 - 12:21)** - Normal event (weight = 1).
4. **Shopping at farmer's market (15:55 - 17:40)** - Normal event (weight = 1).

### Analysis:
- **Jogging at the park** starts at 03:34 and ends at 05:19. It has a conflict with the **deep cleaning the kitchen**, which also starts at 03:39. Since jogging is a priority event, we must keep it as scheduled.
- This means the deep cleaning event cannot happen, so we exclude it from the schedule.
- **Cooking pasta** and **shopping at farmer's market** have no conflicts with each other and with the jogging event. Therefore, both can be included in the schedule.

### Final Schedule:
- **Jogging at the park**: 03:34 - 05:19 (Weight = 2)
- **Cooking pasta**: 12:06 - 12:21 (Weight = 1)
- **Shopping at farmer's market**: 15:55 - 17:40 (Weight = 1)

By excluding the deep cleaning event, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations without violating any constraints.
