To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to prioritize the "Quantum computing guest talk" and ensure that no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate each event:

1. **Quantum computing guest talk (03:56 - 04:56)**: This is a priority event and should be included as soon as possible.
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (07:50 - 08:35)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and can be scheduled after the guest talk.
3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (11:39 - 13:09)**: This event also does not conflict with any other events and can be scheduled after the office hours.
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (13:54 - 14:39)**: This event conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture (13:59 - 15:29). Since the Structural Dynamics lecture has a higher weight (due to its duration), it will be kept. The study session must be excluded.
5. **Structural Dynamics lecture (13:59 - 15:29)**: This event has a higher weight due to its duration and cannot be excluded.
6. **Chemistry experiment (17:15 - 17:45)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and can be scheduled after the Structural Dynamics lecture.
7. **Researching in library (20:39 - 21:39)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and can be scheduled at the end of the day.

By following these steps, we can create the optimized schedule:
