To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, we need to prioritize the "Yoga class with Emily" event since it has a weight of 2. This means it should not be moved or replaced unless there is no other way to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without violating any rules.

Let's evaluate the potential placements:

1. **Walking with Bella (00:59 - 02:59)**: This event can be included as it starts before the farmer's market and does not overlap with any other event.
2. **Shopping at farmer's market (02:34 - 03:34)**: This event starts after Walking with Bella and ends before Calling Mom and Dad. It can be included as well.
3. **Calling Mom and Dad (06:59 - 07:44)**: This event can be included as it starts after Shopping at farmer's market and does not overlap with any other event.
4. **Jogging at the park (07:50 - 09:05)**: This event starts after Calling Mom and Dad but overlaps with the "Yoga class with Emily". Since "Yoga class with Emily" has a higher weight, jogging cannot be included.
5. **Yoga class with Emily (10:11 - 11:11)**: This event can be included as it is prioritized and does not overlap with any other event.
6. **Watching 'Inception' (12:19 - 14:19)**: This event can be included as it starts after Yoga class with Emily and does not overlap with any other event.

By following these steps, we ensure that the "Yoga class with Emily" is included, and all other events fit within the schedule without overlapping or conflicting with each other.
