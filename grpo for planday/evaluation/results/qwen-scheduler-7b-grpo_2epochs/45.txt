To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them accordingly.

1. **Client call with Acme Corp (03:12 - 05:12)**: This is a normal event with a duration of 2 hours.
2. **Analyzing product performance (04:28 - 05:13)**: This is a normal event with a duration of 45 minutes.
3. **Meeting with Lisa at café (06:34 - 07:49)**: This is a normal event with a duration of 1 hour 15 minutes.
4. **Preparing PTO handover (14:32 - 15:47)**: This is a high-priority event with a duration of 1 hour 15 minutes.
5. **Q1 revenue report writing (19:05 - 20:05)**: This is a high-priority event with a duration of 1 hour.

Given the priorities, we need to ensure that "Preparing PTO handover" and "Q1 revenue report writing" are included in the schedule. Since these two events have overlapping times (14:32 - 15:47), we will only include the one with higher weight, which is "Preparing PTO handover".

Let's construct the schedule:

- **Client call with Acme Corp (03:12 - 05:12)**: Duration = 2 hours, Weight = 1
- **Analyzing product performance (04:28 - 05:13)**: Duration = 45 minutes, Weight = 1
- **Meeting with Lisa at café (06:34 - 07:49)**: Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes, Weight = 1
- **Preparing PTO handover (14:32 - 15:47)**: Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes, Weight = 2

Now, let's calculate the total weighted duration:
- Client call with Acme Corp: 2 hours * 1 = 2
- Analyzing product performance: 45 minutes * 1/60 = 0.75
- Meeting with Lisa at café: 1 hour 15 minutes * 1 = 1.25
- Preparing PTO handover: 1 hour 15 minutes * 2 = 2.5

Total weighted duration = 2 + 0.75 + 1.25 + 2.5 = 6.5

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
