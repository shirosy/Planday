To create an optimized schedule while respecting the given constraints, I need to prioritize the meeting with Lisa at the café (weight = 2) and ensure it doesn't conflict with any other events. Let's evaluate the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Q1 revenue report writing**: This event starts at 04:26 and ends at 05:11. It conflicts with the meeting with Lisa at the café from 04:53 to 05:08. Since the meeting has higher priority, we will exclude the reporting task during this period.

2. **Meeting with Lisa at café**: This event is prioritized and should be included as is, from 04:53 to 05:08.

3. **One-on-one with manager**: This event starts at 06:09 and ends at 06:24. It does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

4. **Preparing PTO handover**: This event starts at 12:27 and ends at 13:57. It does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

5. **Analyzing product performance**: This event starts at 15:09 and ends at 16:54. It does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

6. **Updating website content**: This event starts at 16:03 and ends at 18:03. However, it conflicts with the analyzing product performance event from 16:03 to 16:54. Since the analyzing product performance event has higher priority, we will exclude updating the website content during this period.

Based on this analysis, here is the optimized schedule:
