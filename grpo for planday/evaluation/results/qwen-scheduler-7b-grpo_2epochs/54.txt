To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, I need to ensure that the highest priority events (Office hours with Prof. Chen and Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams) are included without overlap. Let's analyze the timeline:

1. **Researching in library (09:35 - 11:05)**: This event does not conflict with any priorities.
2. **Group study for physics test (10:41 - 10:56)**: This event conflicts with the group study for the physics test, which is part of the research period. We will exclude this event.
3. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (12:39 - 13:24)**: High priority event.
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (12:55 - 13:40)**: Conflicts with the office hours with Prof. Chen. We will exclude this event.
5. **Structural Dynamics lecture (15:58 - 16:43)**: Does not conflict with any priorities.
6. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (18:06 - 19:51)**: High priority event.

Given the constraints, we can include both high-priority events without overlapping. We will exclude the conflicting study sessions and group studies.

Final schedule:
1. Researching in library (09:35 - 11:05)
2. Office hours with Prof. Chen (12:39 - 13:24)
3. Structural Dynamics lecture (15:58 - 16:43)
4. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (18:06 - 19:51)
