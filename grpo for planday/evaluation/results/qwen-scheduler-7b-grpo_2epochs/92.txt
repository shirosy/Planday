To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, we need to carefully consider the priorities and non-overlapping requirements.

### Events Overview:
1. **Sum 41 concert**: 06:38 - 08:23 (Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes)
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass**: 07:40 - 08:55 (Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes)
3. **Jam session**: 10:02 - 10:47 (Duration: 45 minutes)
4. **David Bowie tribute concert**: 10:12 - 10:42 (Duration: 30 minutes)
5. **Fireworks**: 17:50 - 18:05 (Duration: 15 minutes)
6. **Avril Lavigne concert**: 18:29 - 19:59 (Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes)
7. **David Guetta DJ set**: 20:11 - 21:26 (Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes)

### Priorities:
- **Fireworks** (weight = 2)
- **Avril Lavigne concert** (weight = 2)

### Constraints:
- Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
- No overlaps allowed.
- Higher-weighted events take precedence over lower-weighted events in case of conflicts.

### Analysis:
1. **Sum 41 concert (06:38 - 08:23)**: This event has a high duration but no immediate conflicts with other events.
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass (07:40 - 08:55)**: Conflicts with the Sum 41 concert. Since it's less critical, it might be excluded.
3. **Jam session (10:02 - 10:47)**: Conflicts with the David Bowie tribute concert. Both have low priority, so one might be excluded.
4. **David Bowie tribute concert (10:12 - 10:42)**: Conflicts with the Jam session. Both have low priority, so one might be excluded.
5. **Fireworks (17:50 - 18:05)**: High priority event.
6. **Avril Lavigne concert (18:29 - 19:59)**: High priority event.
7. **David Guetta DJ set (20:11 - 21:26)**: No conflicts with other events and has a decent duration.

### Schedule Optimization:
- Exclude the **Backstage tour VIP pass** (07:40 - 08:55) because it conflicts with the Sum 41 concert and is less critical.
- Exclude the **Jam session** (10:02 - 10:47) because it conflicts with the David Bowie tribute concert and both have low priority.
- Exclude the **David Bowie tribute concert** (10:12 - 10:42) because it conflicts with the Jam session and both have low priority.

### Final Schedule:
- **Sum 41 concert**: 06:38 - 08:23 (Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes)
- **Fireworks**: 17:50 - 18:05 (Duration: 15 minutes)
- **Avril Lavigne concert**: 18:29 - 19:59 (Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes)
- **David Guetta DJ set**: 20:11 - 21:26 (Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
