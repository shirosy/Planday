To create an optimized schedule that respects the given rules and priorities, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the events and their weights.
2. Ensure that no events overlap, respecting the higher weighted events when conflicts arise.
3. Prioritize the Silent disco party and Backstage tour VIP pass.
4. Adjust the schedule as necessary to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without violating any rules.

Here's the initial list of events with their weights:
- Jam session (02:01 - 03:46): Weight = 1
- Sum 41 concert (04:38 - 06:23): Weight = 1
- Backstage tour VIP pass (13:15 - 14:15): Weight = 2
- David Guetta DJ set (17:23 - 18:23): Weight = 1
- Silent disco party (17:59 - 18:59): Weight = 2

Given the constraints, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Jam session** (02:01 - 03:46): Weight = 1
2. **Sum 41 concert** (04:38 - 06:23): Weight = 1
3. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (13:15 - 14:15): Weight = 2
4. **Silent disco party** (17:59 - 18:59): Weight = 2

The David Guetta DJ set (17:23 - 18:23) conflicts with both the Silent disco party and the Backstage tour VIP pass. Since the Silent disco party has a higher weight, we exclude the David Guetta DJ set from the schedule.

Final schedule:
- Jam session (02:01 - 03:46)
- Sum 41 concert (04:38 - 06:23)
- Backstage tour VIP pass (13:15 - 14:15)
- Silent disco party (17:59 - 18:59)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all rules and priorities.
