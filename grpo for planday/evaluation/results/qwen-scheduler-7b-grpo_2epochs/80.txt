To create an optimized schedule that respects all rules and prioritizes the "Meeting with Lisa at café," we need to carefully analyze the overlap and ensure no conflicts occur. Let's break down the events and prioritize accordingly:

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:41 - 04:11)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
2. **One-on-one with manager (04:59 - 06:14)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
3. **Client call with Acme Corp (09:15 - 10:30)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
4. **Preparing PTO handover (16:21 - 17:21)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
5. **Q1 revenue report writing (19:34 - 21:19)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
6. **Meeting with Lisa at café (20:04 - 21:04)**: Priority event (weight = 2)

Given that the "Meeting with Lisa at café" has the highest priority, it should not conflict with any other event. Let's see how the schedule looks when we include it:

- **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:41 - 04:11)**: No conflict with the priority event.
- **One-on-one with manager (04:59 - 06:14)**: Conflicts with the marketing standup. Since the one-on-one starts later, it does not interfere.
- **Client call with Acme Corp (09:15 - 10:30)**: No conflict with the priority event.
- **Preparing PTO handover (16:21 - 17:21)**: No conflict with the priority event.
- **Q1 revenue report writing (19:34 - 21:19)**: Conflicts with the meeting with Lisa. Since the meeting ends before the report writing begins, it does not interfere.
- **Meeting with Lisa at café (20:04 - 21:04)**: Prioritized and non-conflicting.

The "Meeting with Lisa at café" will take precedence over the Q1 revenue report writing due to its higher priority. Therefore, the Q1 revenue report writing will be excluded from the schedule to avoid conflict.

Final Schedule:
- Marketing standup on Zoom (02:41 - 04:11)
- One-on-one with manager (04:59 - 06:14)
- Client call with Acme Corp (09:15 - 10:30)
- Preparing PTO handover (16:21 - 17:21)
- Meeting with Lisa at café (20:04 - 21:04)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all rules.
