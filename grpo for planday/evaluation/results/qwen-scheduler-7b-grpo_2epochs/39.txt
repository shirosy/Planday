To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and ensure they are included in the schedule.
2. Place the priority events at their earliest possible time slots without overlapping other events.
3. Fill in the remaining time slots with the highest-weighted events (normal events with weight = 1).
4. Ensure no overlaps and that the schedule remains in chronological order.

Given priorities:
- AI keynote (16:22 - 17:52)
- Trying new VR headset (05:33 - 06:03)

Let's start placing the events:

1. **Digital detox meditation session (02:36 - 03:06)** - This is a normal event with weight = 1.
2. **Trying new VR headset (05:33 - 06:03)** - This is a priority event with weight = 2.
3. **Small Language Models talk (10:16 - 11:31)** - This is a normal event with weight = 1.
4. **Live coding on Rust (10:40 - 11:10)** - This is a normal event with weight = 1, but it overlaps with the Small Language Models talk. We need to exclude one of them. Let's exclude the Live coding on Rust.
5. **Web3 panel discussion (12:43 - 14:43)** - This is a normal event with weight = 1.
6. **AI keynote (16:22 - 17:52)** - This is a priority event with weight = 2.
7. **Networking with engineers (18:33 - 20:03)** - This is a normal event with weight = 1.
8. **Async Python talk (18:51 - 19:06)** - This is a normal event with weight = 1, but it overlaps with the Networking with engineers. We need to exclude one of them. Let's exclude the Async Python talk.

Final schedule:
- Digital detox meditation session (02:36 - 03:06)
- Trying new VR headset (05:33 - 06:03)
- Small Language Models talk (10:16 - 11:31)
- Web3 panel discussion (12:43 - 14:43)
- AI keynote (16:22 - 17:52)
- Networking with engineers (18:33 - 20:03)

This schedule respects the given constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
