To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. **List all events with their start and end times**:
   - Q1 revenue report writing (00:26 - 00:56)
   - Updating website content (00:44 - 01:14)
   - One-on-one with manager (03:32 - 05:32)
   - Analyzing product performance (13:03 - 13:18)
   - Replying to emails (16:53 - 17:53)
   - Preparing PTO handover (19:18 - 21:03)

2. **Identify priority events**:
   - Updating website content (weight = 2)

3. **Place priority events first**:
   - Since "Updating website content" has a higher priority, it should be placed as early as possible without conflicting with other events.

4. **Check for conflicts and overlaps**:
   - Place "Q1 revenue report writing" from 00:26 - 00:56.
   - Place "Updating website content" from 00:44 - 01:14. This conflicts with "Q1 revenue report writing," so we need to exclude one of them. Since "Updating website content" has higher priority, we keep it and exclude "Q1 revenue report writing."
   - Place "One-on-one with manager" from 03:32 - 05:32.
   - Place "Analyzing product performance" from 13:03 - 13:18.
   - Place "Replying to emails" from 16:53 - 17:53.
   - Place "Preparing PTO handover" from 19:18 - 21:03.

5. **Verify the schedule**:
   - Ensure no overlaps exist.
   - Confirm that "Updating website content" is included and prioritized correctly.

Final Schedule:
- Updating website content (00:44 - 01:14)
- One-on-one with manager (03:32 - 05:32)
- Analyzing product performance (13:03 - 13:18)
- Replying to emails (16:53 - 17:53)
- Preparing PTO handover (19:18 - 21:03)
