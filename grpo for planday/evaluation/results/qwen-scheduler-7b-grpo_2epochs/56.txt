To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to prioritize the events that have higher weights and ensure there are no overlaps. Let's analyze the events step-by-step:

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:08 - 02:23)** - Weight: 2
2. **One-on-one with manager (04:30 - 05:45)** - Weight: 1
3. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (07:44 - 09:44)** - Weight: 2
4. **Analyzing product performance (11:08 - 13:08)** - Weight: 1
5. **Preparing PTO handover (14:20 - 16:20)** - Weight: 1
6. **Meeting with Lisa at café (17:44 - 19:14)** - Weight: 1
7. **Replying to emails (18:05 - 20:05)** - Weight: 1

Given the priorities, we should prioritize the brainstorming session and the marketing standup. However, we also need to consider the overlapping times and ensure that the schedule remains valid.

Let's try to fit the events into the schedule:

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:08 - 02:23)** - Weight: 2
   - This event starts first and has the highest priority.

2. **One-on-one with manager (04:30 - 05:45)** - Weight: 1
   - This event can fit after the marketing standup as it does not overlap with any other high-priority event.

3. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (07:44 - 09:44)** - Weight: 2
   - This event can fit after the one-on-one meeting as it does not overlap with any other high-priority event.

4. **Analyzing product performance (11:08 - 13:08)** - Weight: 1
   - This event can fit after the brainstorming session as it does not overlap with any other high-priority event.

5. **Preparing PTO handover (14:20 - 16:20)** - Weight: 1
   - This event can fit after the analyzing product performance session as it does not overlap with any other high-priority event.

6. **Meeting with Lisa at café (17:44 - 19:14)** - Weight: 1
   - This event can fit after the preparing PTO handover session as it does not overlap with any other high-priority event.

7. **Replying to emails (18:05 - 20:05)** - Weight: 1
   - This event can fit after the meeting with Lisa as it does not overlap with any other high-priority event.

After evaluating all the options, it seems that all events can fit into the schedule without any overlaps. Therefore, we will include all events in the schedule.
