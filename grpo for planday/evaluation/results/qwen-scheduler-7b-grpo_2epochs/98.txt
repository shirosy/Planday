To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to prioritize the events according to their weights and ensure no overlaps. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List Events by Start Time**: 
   - Chemistry experiment (03:56 - 04:56)
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen (10:43 - 11:43)
   - Researching in library (12:16 - 14:16)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:54 - 16:09)
   - Chess with Daniel (15:07 - 15:52)
   - Group study for physics test (18:06 - 18:51)

2. **Identify Conflicts**:
   - The calculus lecture (14:54 - 16:09) overlaps with the chess session (15:07 - 15:52). Since the chess session has higher priority, it should be included.

3. **Remove Overlapping Events**:
   - Remove the overlapping part of the calculus lecture from 15:07 to 15:52.

4. **Reconstruct the Schedule**:
   - Chemistry experiment (03:56 - 04:56)
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen (10:43 - 11:43)
   - Researching in library (12:16 - 14:16)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:54 - 16:09)
   - Chess with Daniel (15:07 - 15:52)
   - Group study for physics test (18:06 - 18:51)

5. **Calculate Weighted Durations**:
   - Chemistry experiment: 1 hour * 1 = 1
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen: 1 hour * 1 = 1
   - Researching in library: 2 hours * 1 = 2
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 1 hour 15 minutes * 1 = 1.25
   - Chess with Daniel: 45 minutes * 2 = 0.75
   - Group study for physics test: 45 minutes * 1 = 0.75

   Total weighted duration: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1.25 + 0.75 + 0.75 = 6

The schedule meets all the given constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
