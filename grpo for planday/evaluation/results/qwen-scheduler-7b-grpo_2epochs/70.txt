To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to prioritize the events that have the highest weight (Reading 'Dune' and Walking with Bella). We should also ensure that no overlapping events occur and that the total weighted duration is maximized.

Let's analyze the events:

1. **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen** (02:59 - 03:59): Weight = 1
2. **Walking with Bella** (07:17 - 08:17): Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Reading 'Dune'** (07:59 - 09:29): Weight = 2 (Priority)
4. **Cooking Pasta** (10:20 - 12:20): Weight = 1
5. **Calling Mom and Dad** (18:44 - 18:59): Weight = 1
6. **Watching 'Inception'** (18:58 - 19:58): Weight = 1

Given the priorities and the need to avoid overlaps, let's construct the schedule:

- **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen** (02:59 - 03:59): This is the first event, so it starts at its scheduled time.
- **Walking with Bella** (07:17 - 08:17): This event has high priority and does not overlap with any other events.
- **Reading 'Dune'** (07:59 - 09:29): This event has high priority and follows directly after Walking with Bella without overlap.
- **Cooking Pasta** (10:20 - 12:20): This event fits perfectly after Reading 'Dune'.
- **Calling Mom and Dad** (18:44 - 18:59): This event fits before Watching 'Inception' without overlap.
- **Watching 'Inception'** (18:58 - 19:58): This event fits after Calling Mom and Dad.

By following this approach, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
