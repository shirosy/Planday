To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully consider the priorities and ensure that no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate each event:

1. **Chess with Daniel**: 02:19 - 03:04 (weight = 1)
2. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 02:52 - 04:07 (weight = 1)
3. **Researching in library**: 09:53 - 11:08 (weight = 2)
4. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 18:38 - 19:08 (weight = 1)

The **Researching in library** event has the highest priority (weight = 2). Therefore, it should not overlap with any other event. 

Let's analyze the time slots:

- **Chess with Daniel**: 02:19 - 03:04
- **Quantum computing guest talk**: 02:52 - 04:07
- **Researching in library**: 09:53 - 11:08
- **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 18:38 - 19:08

We see that there is a conflict between the **Chess with Daniel** and **Quantum computing guest talk** events. Since both have a weight of 1, we need to choose one. Given that the quantum computing guest talk has a longer duration, it might be more beneficial to keep it, as it provides more value.

Now, let's re-evaluate the schedule:

1. **Chess with Daniel**: 02:19 - 03:04 (conflicts with Quantum computing guest talk, so exclude)
2. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 02:52 - 04:07
3. **Researching in library**: 09:53 - 11:08
4. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 18:38 - 19:08

This schedule respects the priority of the research event and avoids overlaps. The total weighted duration is calculated as follows:

- **Quantum computing guest talk**: 1 hour 15 minutes (weight = 1)
- **Researching in library**: 1 hour 15 minutes (weight = 2)
- **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 30 minutes (weight = 1)

Total weighted duration: \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without violating any rules.
