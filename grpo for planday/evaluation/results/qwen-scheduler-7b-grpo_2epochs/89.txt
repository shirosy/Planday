To create an optimized schedule, we need to consider the constraints and priorities provided:

1. **Chronological Order**: Events must remain in their original order unless their actual start times are different.
2. **Priority Events**: The "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams" has a higher priority (weight = 2) compared to other events (weight = 1).
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: We should prioritize including events that contribute more to the total weighted duration without violating any constraints.
4. **No Overlaps**: If there's a conflict between two events, the one with the higher weight should be included, and the other should be excluded.

Let's analyze the events:

- **Researching in library (01:53 - 02:23)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
- **Office hours with Prof. Chen (01:58 - 03:28)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
- **Chemistry experiment (15:21 - 17:21)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
- **Structural Dynamics lecture (17:42 - 18:57)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
- **Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:49 - 19:34)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:40 - 22:55)**: Priority event (weight = 2)

Given the high priority of the Calculus lecture, it should be included if possible. Let's see how it fits into the schedule:

1. **Researching in library (01:53 - 02:23)**: Included
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (01:58 - 03:28)**: Conflicts with Researching in library. Since Researching in library has a lower weight, exclude Office hours with Prof. Chen.
3. **Chemistry experiment (15:21 - 17:21)**: Included
4. **Structural Dynamics lecture (17:42 - 18:57)**: Conflicts with Chemistry experiment. Since Chemistry experiment has a lower weight, exclude Structural Dynamics lecture.
5. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:49 - 19:34)**: Conflicts with Study session with Sarah and Mike. Since Study session with Sarah and Mike has a lower weight, exclude Study session with Sarah and Mike.
6. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:40 - 22:55)**: Included

By following these steps, we ensure that the highest priority event is included while respecting all constraints.
