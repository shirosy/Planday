To create an optimized schedule while respecting all the rules, let's analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given criteria:

1. **Small Language Models talk** (00:53 - 02:38) - Weight = 1
2. **Drone building hackathon** (02:50 - 03:20) - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **3D printing workshop** (02:52 - 04:37) - Weight = 1
4. **Networking with engineers** (06:16 - 06:31) - Weight = 1
5. **Trying new VR headset** (06:17 - 06:47) - Weight = 1
6. **Live coding on Rust** (08:35 - 09:05) - Weight = 1
7. **Async Python talk** (09:41 - 11:41) - Weight = 1

Given that the "Drone building hackathon" has the highest priority (weight = 2), we need to ensure it does not conflict with any other event. Let's see how it fits into the schedule:

- The "Drone building hackathon" starts at 02:50 and ends at 03:20.
- This event overlaps with the "3D printing workshop," which also starts at 02:52 and ends at 04:37.

Since the "Drone building hackathon" has higher priority, we will exclude the "3D printing workshop."

Now, let's re-evaluate the schedule without the "3D printing workshop":

1. **Small Language Models talk** (00:53 - 02:38) - Weight = 1
2. **Drone building hackathon** (02:50 - 03:20) - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Networking with engineers** (06:16 - 06:31) - Weight = 1
4. **Trying new VR headset** (06:17 - 06:47) - Weight = 1
5. **Live coding on Rust** (08:35 - 09:05) - Weight = 1
6. **Async Python talk** (09:41 - 11:41) - Weight = 1

The "Networking with engineers" and "Trying new VR headset" overlap at 06:17, so we need to choose one. Since both have equal priority, we'll keep the first one listed:

1. **Small Language Models talk** (00:53 - 02:38) - Weight = 1
2. **Drone building hackathon** (02:50 - 03:20) - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Networking with engineers** (06:16 - 06:31) - Weight = 1
4. **Live coding on Rust** (08:35 - 09:05) - Weight = 1
5. **Async Python talk** (09:41 - 11:41) - Weight = 1

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while ensuring no overlaps.
