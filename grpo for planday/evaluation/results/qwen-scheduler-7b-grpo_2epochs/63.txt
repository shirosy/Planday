To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate the events step by step:

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)**: Weight = 1
2. **Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)**: Weight = 1
3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)**: Weight = 1
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)**: Weight = 2
5. **Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)**: Weight = 2
6. **Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)**: Weight = 1
7. **Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)**: Weight = 1

Given the priorities:
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: This event has a high priority and should not be moved or excluded.
- **Researching in library**: This event also has a high priority and should not be moved or excluded.

Let's analyze the potential conflicts:
- The Chess session from 00:51 to 02:21 conflicts with the Office hours from 00:51 to 01:21. Since both have the same weight (1), we will keep the Chess session as it ends later.
- The Group study for physics test from 14:23 to 14:53 conflicts with the Researching in library from 14:18 to 15:18. Since the Researching in library has a higher weight (2), we will exclude the Group study.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)**: Weight = 1
2. **Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)**: Weight = 1
3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)**: Weight = 1
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)**: Weight = 2
5. **Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)**: Weight = 2
6. **Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)**: Weight = 1

The total weighted duration is calculated as follows:
- Office hours: 1 * (01:21 - 00:51) = 0.30 hours
- Chess: 1 * (02:21 - 00:51) = 0.70 hours
- Meeting: 1 * (06:19 - 05:04) = 1.15 hours
- Calculus lecture: 2 * (11:10 - 10:25) = 1.70 hours
- Researching in library: 2 * (15:18 - 14:18) = 2.00 hours
- Quantum computing guest talk: 1 * (22:21 - 21:21) = 0.30 hours

Total weighted duration: 0.30 + 0.70 + 1.15 + 1.70 + 2.00 + 0.30 = 6.05 hours

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
