To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints and priorities, we need to carefully consider the placement of each event. The key points to remember are:

1. **Chronological Order**: Events must be placed in the order they occur.
2. **Priority Events**: High-priority events (AI keynote and Live coding on Rust) should not be moved unless absolutely necessary.
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: We want to maximize the total duration of events, considering their weights.
4. **No Overlaps**: Conflicting events must be handled by keeping the one with higher weight.

Let's analyze the events and their potential placements:

1. **AI keynote (00:20 - 00:50)**: This is a high-priority event. It starts at 00:20 and ends at 00:50.
2. **Small Language Models talk (00:41 - 01:26)**: This event overlaps with the AI keynote. Since it has lower priority, we will exclude it.
3. **Live coding on Rust (04:42 - 06:27)**: This is another high-priority event. It starts at 04:42 and ends at 06:27.
4. **Web3 panel discussion (13:42 - 14:27)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and has a moderate priority.
5. **Async Python talk (15:39 - 17:09)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and has a moderate priority.
6. **Digital detox meditation session (16:16 - 18:01)**: This event overlaps with the Async Python talk. Since it has lower priority, we will exclude it.
7. **Drone building hackathon (18:53 - 20:08)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and has a low priority.

Given these considerations, the optimized schedule would be:

- AI keynote (00:20 - 00:50)
- Live coding on Rust (04:42 - 06:27)
- Web3 panel discussion (13:42 - 14:27)
- Async Python talk (15:39 - 17:09)
- Drone building hackathon (18:53 - 20:08)

This schedule respects the chronological order, includes all high-priority events, and excludes overlapping events with lower priority.
