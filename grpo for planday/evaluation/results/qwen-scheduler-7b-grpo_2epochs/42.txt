To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I need to consider the following:

1. **Chronological Order**: Events must remain in the order they appear.
2. **Absolute Times**: Start and end times cannot be adjusted.
3. **Priority**: The AI keynote has a higher weight (2) compared to other events (1).

Given these rules, I'll analyze the events and prioritize the AI keynote while ensuring no overlaps.

### Analysis:
1. **Digital Detox Meditation Session (02:53 - 04:08)**: This event starts at 02:53 and ends at 04:08.
2. **Drone Building Hackathon (03:52 - 05:52)**: This event starts at 03:52 and ends at 05:52. It conflicts with the digital detox session.
3. **AI Keynote (11:20 - 12:05)**: This event starts at 11:20 and ends at 12:05.
4. **Networking with Engineers (13:31 - 14:46)**: This event starts at 13:31 and ends at 14:46.

### Conflict Resolution:
- The drone building hackathon conflicts with the digital detox session. Since the drone building hackathon has a lower weight (1) compared to the digital detox session (1), we should exclude the drone building hackathon to avoid overlap.

### Final Schedule:
- **Digital Detox Meditation Session (02:53 - 04:08)**: Weight = 1
- **AI Keynote (11:20 - 12:05)**: Weight = 2
- **Networking with Engineers (13:31 - 14:46)**: Weight = 1

This schedule respects the chronological order, avoids overlaps, and includes the priority event (AI keynote). The total weighted duration is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 units.
