To create an optimized schedule that respects the given rules and prioritizes "Watching 'Inception'", I need to consider the following:

1. **Yoga class with Emily**: This event starts at 03:51 and ends at 05:21.
2. **Cooking pasta**: This event starts at 04:01 and ends at 05:16.
3. **Deep cleaning the kitchen**: This event starts at 09:02 and ends at 10:02.
4. **Watching 'Inception'**: This event starts at 16:54 and ends at 18:39.

The key points are:
- "Watching 'Inception'" has a higher priority (weight = 2).
- We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
- Events must respect their absolute start and end times.

Given that "Watching 'Inception'" starts at 16:54, it cannot overlap with any other event. Let's analyze the conflict between "Yoga class with Emily" and "Cooking pasta":

- Both events overlap from 04:01 to 05:16. Since both have a weight of 1, we need to decide which one to keep.
- To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should exclude the event with the lower weight. In this case, "Cooking pasta" (weight = 1) should be excluded.

Therefore, the optimal schedule will include:
- "Yoga class with Emily" (03:51 - 05:21)
- "Deep cleaning the kitchen" (09:02 - 10:02)
- "Watching 'Inception'" (16:54 - 18:39)

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
