To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, let's analyze the given events and priorities step-by-step:

1. **Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes. It does not conflict with any other events and can be included without affecting the schedule.

2. **Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour and 30 minutes. It starts at 14:21 and ends at 15:51. 

3. **Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes. It starts at 15:21 and ends at 17:06. However, it conflicts with the Korean BBQ food trucks from 15:21 to 15:51. Since the silent disco party has a higher priority, we will exclude the Korean BBQ food trucks during this overlapping period.

4. **Avril Lavigne concert (20:34 - 21:49)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes. It starts at 20:34 and ends at 21:49.

5. **Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)**: This event has a duration of 15 minutes. It starts at 21:03 and ends at 21:18. However, it conflicts with the Avril Lavigne concert from 21:03 to 21:18. Since the Sum 41 concert has a higher priority, we will exclude the Avril Lavigne concert during this overlapping period.

Given these considerations, the optimized schedule should look like this:

- Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)
- Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
- Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)

This schedule respects all constraints, includes the highest priority events, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
