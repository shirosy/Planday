To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, let's evaluate each event and its priority:

1. **Structural Dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21)**: This is a normal event with a low priority (weight = 1).
2. **Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00)**: This is a high-priority event (weight = 2). It should ideally not overlap with any other event.
3. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41)**: This is a high-priority event (weight = 2).
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (11:53 - 12:23)**: This is a normal event with a low priority (weight = 1).
5. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (12:31 - 12:46)**: This is a normal event with a low priority (weight = 1).
6. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:30 - 15:00)**: This is a normal event with a low priority (weight = 1).
7. **Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21)**: This is a high-priority event (weight = 2).
8. **Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34)**: This is a normal event with a low priority (weight = 1).

Given that the quantum computing guest talk and office hours with Prof. Chen have the highest priority, we need to ensure they do not overlap with any other events. Additionally, chess with Daniel also has high priority and should not overlap with any other events.

Let's analyze the potential conflicts:

- **Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00)**: This conflicts with the structural dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21). We must choose one. Since the quantum computing guest talk has higher priority, we keep it and exclude the structural dynamics lecture.
- **Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41)**: This does not conflict with any other events.
- **Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21)**: This conflicts with the study session with Sarah and Mike (14:30 - 15:00). We must choose one. Since chess with Daniel has higher priority, we keep it and exclude the study session with Sarah and Mike.
- **Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34)**: This does not conflict with any other events.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. Structural Dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21) - Excluded
2. Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00) - Included (Priority = 2)
3. Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41) - Included (Priority = 2)
4. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (11:53 - 12:23) - Included (Priority = 1)
5. Meeting with Emma and Jake (12:31 - 12:46) - Included (Priority = 1)
6. Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21) - Included (Priority = 2)
7. Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34) - Included (Priority = 1)

The total weighted duration is calculated as follows:
- Quantum computing guest talk: 1 hour * 2 = 2 units
- Office hours with Prof. Chen: 1 hour 15 minutes * 2 ≈ 2.25 units
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 30 minutes * 1 = 0.5 units
- Meeting with Emma and Jake: 15 minutes * 1 = 0.25 units
- Chess with Daniel: 45 minutes * 2 ≈ 0.75 units
- Group study for physics test: 1 hour 30 minutes * 1 = 1.5 units

Total weighted duration = 2 + 2.25 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.75 + 1.5 = 7 units

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
