First, let's list all the events and their priorities:

1. Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:02 - 00:47) - Weight = 2
2. Jogging at the park (02:00 - 03:30) - Weight = 1
3. Walking with Bella (02:00 - 02:30) - Weight = 1
4. Shopping at farmer's market (04:39 - 06:24) - Weight = 1
5. Yoga class with Emily (18:30 - 20:00) - Weight = 2

We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the chronological order and avoiding overlaps. Let's evaluate the options:

- If we include both "Deep cleaning the kitchen" and "Yoga class with Emily," there will be no overlap since they don't conflict chronologically.
- We should exclude the other events as they either have lower priority or would cause overlaps if included.

Let's calculate the total duration for the selected events:
- Deep cleaning the kitchen: 00:45 (2 * 45 minutes)
- Yoga class with Emily: 01:30 (2 * 60 minutes)

Total weighted duration: 00:45 + 01:30 = 02:15

This is the optimal solution as it maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any conflicts.
