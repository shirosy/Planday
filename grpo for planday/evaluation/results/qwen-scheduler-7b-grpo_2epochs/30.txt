To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to ensure that the most important events are included without overlapping. Let's analyze the events and prioritize them:

1. **One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32)**: Weight = 1
2. **Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07)**: Weight = 1
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13)**: Weight = 2 (Priority)
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:06 - 17:51)**: Weight = 1
5. **Replying to emails (18:55 - 19:10)**: Weight = 1
6. **Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30)**: Weight = 1
7. **Meeting with Lisa at café (19:58 - 21:58)**: Weight = 1

Given that the "Marketing standup on Zoom" has the highest priority (weight = 2), it should not be removed or delayed. Let's see how we can fit the other events around it:

- The one-on-one with the manager (01:17 - 01:32) and preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07) can be scheduled before the marketing standup since they have lower weights.
- The brainstorming session (17:06 - 17:51) fits well after the marketing standup.
- The client call (19:30 - 20:30) can be scheduled just before the meeting with Lisa (19:58 - 21:58).

Let's try to maximize the sum of weighted event durations:

1. **One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32)**: Weight = 1
2. **Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07)**: Weight = 1
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13)**: Weight = 2
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:06 - 17:51)**: Weight = 1
5. **Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30)**: Weight = 1
6. **Meeting with Lisa at café (19:58 - 21:58)**: Weight = 1

The total weighted duration is: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

This schedule respects all the constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
