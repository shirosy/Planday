To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, we need to carefully consider the constraints and priorities. Let's break down the events:

1. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 02:35 - 04:35 (Weight = 1)
2. **Group study for physics test**: 08:38 - 09:53 (Weight = 1)
3. **Chemistry experiment**: 09:27 - 09:42 (Weight = 1)
4. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 11:02 - 12:17 (Weight = 2)

The priority event is the "Quantum computing guest talk" (11:02 - 12:17). This event has a higher weight and should not be removed or delayed unless absolutely necessary.

Let's analyze the schedule:

- The Structural Dynamics lecture is from 02:35 to 04:35.
- The Group study for physics test is from 08:38 to 09:53.
- The Chemistry experiment is from 09:27 to 09:42. However, this event overlaps with the Group study for physics test, which means it cannot happen as scheduled. We need to exclude one of them to avoid overlap.

Since the priority is the Quantum computing guest talk, we should try to fit it into the schedule without causing any other event to be excluded. Let's see if we can accommodate it:

- If we exclude the Chemistry experiment, the Group study for physics test remains from 08:38 to 09:53.
- Now, let's see if the Quantum computing guest talk fits after the Group study. It starts at 11:02, which is after the Group study ends at 09:53. Therefore, it does not conflict with the Group study.

So, the final schedule would look like this:

1. Structural Dynamics lecture: 02:35 - 04:35
2. Group study for physics test: 08:38 - 09:53
3. Quantum computing guest talk: 11:02 - 12:17

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the given rules.
