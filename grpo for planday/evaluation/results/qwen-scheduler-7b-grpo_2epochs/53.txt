To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the chemistry experiment and ensure it doesn't overlap with any other events. Let's evaluate the schedule step by step:

1. **Researching in library (03:27 - 03:57)**: This event has a duration of 30 minutes and no conflicts with other events.
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (05:52 - 07:52)**: This event has a duration of 2 hours and no conflicts with other events.
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10)**: This event has a duration of 70 minutes and no conflicts with other events.
4. **Chemistry experiment (21:02 - 22:02)**: This event has a duration of 60 minutes and is prioritized.
5. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (21:13 - 23:13)**: This event has a duration of 2 hours but conflicts with the chemistry experiment.

Since the study session with Sarah and Mike conflicts with the chemistry experiment, we must exclude one of them. Given that the chemistry experiment has higher priority, we will exclude the study session.

Final Schedule:
- Researching in library (03:27 - 03:57)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (05:52 - 07:52)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10)
- Chemistry experiment (21:02 - 22:02)
