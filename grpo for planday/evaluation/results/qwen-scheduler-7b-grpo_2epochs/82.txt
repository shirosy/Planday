To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints, we need to prioritize the events as specified and ensure no overlaps while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations. Let's analyze the events and apply the rules step-by-step:

1. **AI Keynote (03:20 - 05:20)** - This is a priority event (weight = 2).
2. **Async Python Talk (10:33 - 11:33)** - Normal event (weight = 1).
3. **Small Language Models Talk (10:43 - 12:43)** - Conflicts with Async Python Talk. We need to choose one.
4. **Networking with Engineers (16:41 - 17:41)** - Normal event (weight = 1).
5. **3D Printing Workshop (16:57 - 18:27)** - Conflicts with Networking with Engineers. We need to choose one.
6. **Live Coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20)** - Normal event (weight = 1).
7. **Drone Building Hackathon (19:32 - 21:17)** - Priority event (weight = 2).
8. **Trying New VR Headset (21:23 - 21:38)** - Normal event (weight = 1).

Given the priorities and conflicts, let's make the choices:

- We must include the AI Keynote (03:20 - 05:20) because it's a priority event.
- Between Async Python Talk (10:33 - 11:33) and Small Language Models Talk (10:43 - 12:43), we exclude the one that ends later to avoid conflict. We'll choose Async Python Talk (10:33 - 11:33).
- Between Networking with Engineers (16:41 - 17:41) and 3D Printing Workshop (16:57 - 18:27), we exclude the one that starts earlier to avoid conflict. We'll choose Networking with Engineers (16:41 - 17:41).
- We must include the Drone Building Hackathon (19:32 - 21:17) because it's a priority event.
- Finally, we exclude Trying New VR Headset (21:23 - 21:38) since it conflicts with Drone Building Hackathon.

Thus, our optimized schedule will include the following events:
- AI Keynote (03:20 - 05:20)
- Async Python Talk (10:33 - 11:33)
- Networking with Engineers (16:41 - 17:41)
- Drone Building Hackathon (19:32 - 21:17)
