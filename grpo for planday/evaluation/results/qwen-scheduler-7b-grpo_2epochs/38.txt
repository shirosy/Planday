To create an optimized schedule, I need to ensure that the priority events (Digital detox meditation session and AI keynote) are included and placed in their specified time slots. Additionally, I should maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: 
   - Digital detox meditation session (18:53 - 19:23) [Weight: 2]
   - AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35) [Weight: 2]

2. **Check Conflicts**:
   - The AI keynote overlaps with the networking with engineers (18:01 - 18:16). Since both have the same weight (2), we need to exclude one. Let's exclude the networking with engineers as it occurs before the AI keynote.

3. **Revised Schedule**:
   - Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07)
   - Small Language Models talk (07:05 - 08:50)
   - Async Python talk (16:05 - 16:20)
   - AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35)
   - Digital detox meditation session (18:53 - 19:23)
   - Live coding on Rust (19:45 - 21:00)

4. **Calculate Weighted Durations**:
   - Drone building hackathon: 1 hour 15 minutes (1.25 hours)
   - Small Language Models talk: 1 hour 45 minutes (1.75 hours)
   - Async Python talk: 15 minutes (0.25 hours)
   - AI keynote: 2 hours (2 hours)
   - Digital detox meditation session: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
   - Live coding on Rust: 1 hour 15 minutes (1.25 hours)

   Total weighted duration: 1.25 + 1.75 + 0.25 + 2 + 0.5 + 1.25 = 7.25 hours

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
