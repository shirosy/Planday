To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully consider the priorities and ensure no overlaps. Let's go through the events step-by-step:

1. **Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04)**: This is a normal event.
2. **AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48)**: This is a normal event.
3. **Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01)**: This event overlaps with the AI keynote, so it needs to be excluded.
4. **Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)**: This is a normal event.
5. **Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)**: This is a normal event.
6. **Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)**: This is a normal event.
7. **Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57)**: This is a high-priority event.
8. **Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)**: This is a high-priority event.

Given that the Live coding on Rust and Small Language Models talk both have high priority, we need to choose one of them to include. Since the Small Language Models talk ends later (22:55), it will take precedence over the Live coding on Rust (which ends at 21:57).

Let's remove the Live coding on Rust from the schedule to make room for the Small Language Models talk.

Final Schedule:
1. Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04)
2. AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48)
3. Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)
4. Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)
5. Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)
6. Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)
