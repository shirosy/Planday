To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their weights.
2. List all events in chronological order.
3. Assign weights to each event.
4. Adjust the schedule to ensure no overlaps and prioritize high-weight events over low-weight events when conflicts arise.

**Step 1: Identify priorities**
- Chemistry experiment (weight = 2)

**Step 2 & 3: List events and assign weights**
- Structural Dynamics lecture (09:50 - 10:05) [weight = 1]
- Chemistry experiment (11:18 - 12:48) [weight = 2] (priority)
- Researching in library (20:24 - 22:24) [weight = 1]
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (21:46 - 22:01) [weight = 1]

**Step 4: Adjust the schedule**

The Chemistry experiment has a higher priority (weight = 2) compared to the other events. Therefore, it should not be removed from the schedule. We need to ensure there are no overlaps and maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

- **Structural Dynamics lecture (09:50 - 10:05)** [weight = 1]
- **Chemistry experiment (11:18 - 12:48)** [weight = 2] (prioritized)
- **Researching in library (20:24 - 22:24)** [weight = 1]
- **Office hours with Prof. Chen (21:46 - 22:01)** [weight = 1]

Since the Chemistry experiment does not overlap with any other event, it remains in the schedule. The Researching in library and Office hours with Prof. Chen do not conflict with each other either.

Thus, the final schedule is optimal and respects all constraints.
