To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to ensure that the priority event "Client call with Acme Corp" is placed as early as possible without overlapping other events. Let's evaluate the positions:

1. **Q1 revenue report writing (00:19 - 00:34)**: This is a normal event.
2. **Client call with Acme Corp (15:43 - 17:13)**: This is a high-priority event.
3. **Updating website content (20:54 - 21:24)**: This is a normal event.
4. **Analyzing product performance (21:04 - 21:34)**: This is a normal event.

The key here is to place the priority event as soon as possible. Since it starts at 15:43, it will not overlap with any other events. 

Now let's place the remaining events around it:
- The revenue report writing event (00:19 - 00:34) fits before the client call.
- The updating website content event (20:54 - 21:24) and analyzing product performance event (21:04 - 21:34) do not overlap and fit after the client call.

Thus, the optimal schedule is:

<schedule>
<event>
<name>Q1 revenue report writing</name>
<start>00:19</start>
<end>00:34</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Client call with Acme Corp</name>
<start>15:43</start>
<end>17:13</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Updating website content</name>
<start>20:54</start>
<end>21:24</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Analyzing product performance</name>
<start>21:04</start>
<end>21:34</end>
</event>
</schedule>
