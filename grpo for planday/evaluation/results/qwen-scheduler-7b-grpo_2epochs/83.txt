The task requires creating an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the chronological order and no-overlap rule. Given that "Shopping at farmer's market" has a higher priority (weight = 2) compared to other events (weight = 1), it should be placed as early as possible without conflicting with other events.

Let's analyze the events:

1. **Shopping at farmer's market**: 00:04 - 02:04 (Weight = 2)
2. **Cooking pasta**: 08:47 - 10:02 (Weight = 1)
3. **Planting flowers in the garden**: 20:17 - 21:32 (Weight = 1)
4. **Yoga class with Emily**: 20:32 - 21:02 (Weight = 1)

First, we place the highest priority event:
- **Shopping at farmer's market**: 00:04 - 02:04

Next, we need to fit the remaining events into the schedule without any overlaps. Since "Cooking pasta" starts at 08:47 and ends at 10:02, it does not conflict with "Shopping at farmer's market". So, we add it next:
- **Cooking pasta**: 08:47 - 10:02

Now, we look at "Planting flowers in the garden" and "Yoga class with Emily":
- "Planting flowers in the garden": 20:17 - 21:32
- "Yoga class with Emily": 20:32 - 21:02

Both events overlap from 20:32 to 21:02. According to the rule, we keep the event with the higher weight. However, both have the same weight (1). Therefore, we cannot include both. We must exclude one of them. Since "Planting flowers in the garden" has a slightly longer duration, we will exclude it:
- Exclude: **Planting flowers in the garden**: 20:17 - 21:32

Thus, the optimal schedule is:
- **Shopping at farmer's market**: 00:04 - 02:04
- **Cooking pasta**: 08:47 - 10:02
- **Yoga class with Emily**: 20:32 - 21:02
