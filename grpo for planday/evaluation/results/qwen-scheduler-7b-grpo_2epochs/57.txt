To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules and prioritizes the "Yoga class with Emily," we need to carefully arrange the events while ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

1. **Initial List of Events**:
   - Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24)
   - Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13)
   - Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59)
   - Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41)
   - Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33)

2. **Priority Consideration**:
   - The "Yoga class with Emily" has a priority weight of 2 and should be placed as early as possible without conflicting with other events.

3. **Event Overlap Handling**:
   - If two events overlap, the one with the higher weight (priority) should be kept, and the lower-weight event should be removed.
   - If both events have the same weight, the first event listed should be kept, and the second should be removed.

4. **Optimization Strategy**:
   - Start by placing the "Yoga class with Emily" at its earliest possible slot (01:13 - 02:13).
   - Then, try to fit the remaining events around it, respecting the start and end times and avoiding overlaps.

Let's go through the events step-by-step:

- **Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24)**: This event overlaps with the "Yoga class with Emily." Since the yoga class has a higher priority, we exclude jogging.
- **Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13)**: Placed as is.
- **Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45)**: Fits well after the yoga class.
- **Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59)**: Fits well before walking with Bella.
- **Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41)**: Conflicts with planting flowers. Since walking with Bella has a higher priority, we keep it and remove planting flowers.
- **Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33)**: Fits well after walking with Bella.

Final Schedule:
- Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13)
- Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45)
- Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41)
- Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33)
