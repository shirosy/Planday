To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, I'll first list out the events and their priorities. Then, I'll arrange them in chronological order while ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

Here's the initial list of events:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39) - weight = 1
2. Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37) - weight = 1
3. Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45) - weight = 1
4. Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56) - weight = 2

The priority event is "Study session with Sarah and Mike" which has the highest weight (2).

Now, let's try to fit these events into a schedule:

1. **Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)** - This is a mandatory event and cannot be moved.
2. **Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)** - This event does not conflict with any other events and can be included.
3. **Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45)** - This event conflicts with the Researching in library event. Since it has a lower weight, we will exclude it.
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)** - This event can be included as it has the highest priority.

So, the final schedule will be:
- Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)
- Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
