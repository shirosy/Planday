To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure there are no overlaps. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Digital detox meditation session** (05:59 - 06:14) - Weight = 1
2. **Web3 panel discussion** (06:08 - 08:08) - Weight = 2
3. **Live coding on Rust** (11:23 - 12:23) - Weight = 2
4. **Async Python talk** (20:18 - 22:18) - Weight = 1
5. **Small Language Models talk** (20:35 - 22:35) - Weight = 1

Given the priorities, we should place the Web3 panel discussion and the Live coding on Rust as soon as possible without overlapping. Let's see how we can fit them into the schedule:

- **Digital detox meditation session**: 05:59 - 06:14 (Weight = 1)
- **Web3 panel discussion**: 06:08 - 08:08 (Weight = 2)
- **Live coding on Rust**: 11:23 - 12:23 (Weight = 2)

Next, we need to fit the remaining events:

- **Async Python talk**: 20:18 - 22:18 (Weight = 1)
- **Small Language Models talk**: 20:35 - 22:35 (Weight = 1)

There is a conflict between the Async Python talk and the Small Language Models talk because they overlap from 20:35 to 22:18. Since both have a weight of 1, we need to exclude one of them. To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should exclude the Async Python talk (20:18 - 22:18).

Final Schedule:
1. Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14) - Weight = 1
2. Web3 panel discussion (06:08 - 08:08) - Weight = 2
3. Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23) - Weight = 2
4. Small Language Models talk (20:35 - 22:35) - Weight = 1

Sum of weighted event durations: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6
