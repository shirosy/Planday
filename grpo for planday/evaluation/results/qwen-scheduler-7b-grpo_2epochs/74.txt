To optimize the schedule while respecting all the given rules, we need to prioritize the "Yoga class with Emily" event because it has a higher weight (2). We also need to ensure that no events overlap and that we maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Let's analyze the events:

1. **Planting flowers in the garden** (04:26 - 06:11): Weight = 1
2. **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (06:56 - 07:56): Weight = 1
3. **Calling Mom and Dad** (09:05 - 10:20): Weight = 1
4. **Shopping at farmer's market** (12:33 - 13:18): Weight = 1
5. **Yoga class with Emily** (13:02 - 15:02): Weight = 2

The "Yoga class with Emily" starts at 13:02 and ends at 15:02. This means that any other event scheduled during this time will conflict with it. Let's see how we can fit the other events around this priority event:

- **Planting flowers in the garden**: This event finishes at 06:11, which is before the "Yoga class with Emily" starts.
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen**: This event starts at 06:56, which is after the "Yoga class with Emily" ends.
- **Calling Mom and Dad**: This event starts at 09:05, which is after the "Yoga class with Emily" ends.
- **Shopping at farmer's market**: This event starts at 12:33, which is after the "Yoga class with Emily" ends.

Since none of the other events overlap with the "Yoga class with Emily," we can include all of them in the schedule. Now, let's calculate the sum of the weighted event durations:

- **Planting flowers in the garden**: 1 hour 45 minutes (1 * 1 hour)
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen**: 1 hour (1 * 1 hour)
- **Calling Mom and Dad**: 1 hour 15 minutes (1 * 1 hour)
- **Shopping at farmer's market**: 45 minutes (1 * 0.75 hours)
- **Yoga class with Emily**: 2 hours (2 * 1 hour)

Total weighted duration: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.75 + 2 = 6.75 hours

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.
