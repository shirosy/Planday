To create an optimized schedule that respects all constraints and prioritizes the Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams, we need to carefully manage the event timings and ensure no conflicts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen**: 02:13 - 03:58
   - This event has a duration of 1 hour 45 minutes.

2. **Chess with Daniel**: 03:24 - 04:54
   - This event has a duration of 1 hour 30 minutes.
   - There is a conflict with the office hours because they overlap from 03:24 to 03:58.

3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 07:49 - 08:19
   - This event has a duration of 30 minutes.

4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 12:58 - 14:43
   - This event has a duration of 1 hour 45 minutes.

Given the constraints, let's evaluate the options:

- We cannot keep both the office hours and chess sessions as they overlap. Since the calculus lecture is a priority, we should exclude the overlapping chess session.
- The study session does not conflict with any other event and can be included.

Therefore, the optimal schedule would be:
- Office hours with Prof. Chen: 02:13 - 03:58
- Study session with Sarah and Mike: 07:49 - 08:19
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 12:58 - 14:43

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
