To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints and prioritizes the specified events, I will follow these steps:

1. **List all events and their priorities**:
   - David Bowie tribute concert (03:24 - 04:39, weight = 2)
   - Jam session (11:32 - 12:17, weight = 1)
   - Silent disco party (15:10 - 16:55, weight = 2)
   - Sum 41 concert (15:21 - 16:21, weight = 1)
   - Avril Lavigne concert (21:57 - 22:27, weight = 1)

2. **Identify conflicts and prioritize**:
   - The Silent disco party (15:10 - 16:55) and Sum 41 concert (15:21 - 16:21) overlap.
   - Since both have a weight of 1, we need to exclude one. We should choose the event with the higher weighted time, which is the Silent disco party.

3. **Adjust the schedule**:
   - Remove the Sum 41 concert from the schedule.
   - Ensure that no other conflicts arise due to the removal.

4. **Finalize the schedule**:
   - David Bowie tribute concert (03:24 - 04:39)
   - Jam session (11:32 - 12:17)
   - Silent disco party (15:10 - 16:55)
   - Avril Lavigne concert (21:57 - 22:27)

By following these steps, we ensure that the schedule is in strict chronological order, respects the priority rules, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
