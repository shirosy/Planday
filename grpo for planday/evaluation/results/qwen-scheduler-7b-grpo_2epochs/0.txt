To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur. We will start by placing the priority events first and then fit the other events around them.

1. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (09:08 - 09:23): This is a high-priority event, so it should be placed at its exact time.
2. **Fireworks** (12:27 - 13:12): Another high-priority event, so it should also be placed at its exact time.

Now, let's see how the other events fit into the schedule:

- **The Killers concert** (00:22 - 00:37): This event starts before the Backstage tour VIP pass, so it can remain as is.
- **Sum 41 concert** (02:19 - 03:04): This event fits between The Killers concert and the Jam session.
- **Jam session** (07:47 - 09:17): This event starts after the Backstage tour VIP pass and ends before the Fireworks, so it can remain as is.
- **Korean BBQ food trucks** (12:42 - 14:42): This event overlaps with the Fireworks, which has higher priority. Therefore, we exclude the Korean BBQ food trucks.
- **David Bowie tribute concert** (17:31 - 18:16): This event fits after the Fireworks and does not overlap with any other event, so it can remain as is.

By following these steps, we have created an optimized schedule that respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
