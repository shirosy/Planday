To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, let's analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given criteria:

1. **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen** (02:15 - 03:30): This is a high-priority event (weight = 2).
2. **Watching 'Inception'** (02:51 - 04:21): This is a low-priority event (weight = 1).
3. **Yoga class with Emily** (04:20 - 06:20): This is a low-priority event (weight = 1).
4. **Calling Mom and Dad** (06:45 - 07:30): This is a low-priority event (weight = 1).
5. **Walking with Bella** (20:07 - 21:37): This is a low-priority event (weight = 1).

Given that "Deep Cleaning the Kitchen" is the only high-priority event, it should not be moved or removed. We need to ensure that no other event overlaps with it and that we maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Let's evaluate the schedule:

- **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen** (02:15 - 03:30): Weight = 2
- **Watching 'Inception'** (02:51 - 04:21): Overlaps with "Deep Cleaning the Kitchen", so it cannot be included.
- **Yoga class with Emily** (04:20 - 06:20): Overlaps with "Deep Cleaning the Kitchen", so it cannot be included.
- **Calling Mom and Dad** (06:45 - 07:30): Does not overlap with "Deep Cleaning the Kitchen".
- **Walking with Bella** (20:07 - 21:37): Does not overlap with "Deep Cleaning the Kitchen".

Thus, the optimal schedule includes:
- Deep Cleaning the Kitchen (02:15 - 03:30)
- Calling Mom and Dad (06:45 - 07:30)
- Walking with Bella (20:07 - 21:37)

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
