To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules and prioritizes the "Marketing standup on Zoom," I need to carefully analyze the event timings and determine which events can be included without overlapping.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (01:34 - 03:19)**:
   - This event starts at 01:34 and ends at 03:19. It does not overlap with any other event.

2. **Q1 revenue report writing (01:47 - 02:32)**:
   - This event starts at 01:47 and ends at 02:32. It overlaps with the brainstorming session from 01:47 to 02:32. Since the brainstorming session has a higher priority due to its duration, we will exclude the Q1 revenue report writing.

3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (09:38 - 10:53)**:
   - This event starts at 09:38 and ends at 10:53. It does not overlap with any other event and is a priority event.

4. **Client call with Acme Corp (14:12 - 15:42)**:
   - This event starts at 14:12 and ends at 15:42. It overlaps with the one-on-one with the manager from 14:13 to 15:43. Since the one-on-one with the manager has a higher priority due to its duration, we will exclude the client call with Acme Corp.

5. **One-on-one with manager (14:13 - 15:43)**:
   - This event starts at 14:13 and ends at 15:43. It overlaps with the client call with Acme Corp from 14:13 to 15:43. As mentioned, it has a higher priority and will be included.

6. **Preparing PTO handover (19:30 - 21:00)**:
   - This event starts at 19:30 and ends at 21:00. It does not overlap with any other event.

Based on this analysis, the optimized schedule includes the following events:
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (01:34 - 03:19)
- Marketing standup on Zoom (09:38 - 10:53)
- One-on-one with manager (14:13 - 15:43)
- Preparing PTO handover (19:30 - 21:00)

These events maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the rules.
