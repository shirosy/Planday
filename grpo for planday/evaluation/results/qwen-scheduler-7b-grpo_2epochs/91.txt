To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to prioritize the Avril Lavigne concert and ensure that it does not overlap with any other event. Let's evaluate the potential conflicts:

1. **Fireworks (09:45 - 10:45)** and **Silent disco party (09:50 - 11:05)** overlap. Since both have a weight of 1, we should exclude one of them. We'll keep the Silent disco party because it starts later and has more duration.
2. **Korean BBQ food trucks (12:16 - 13:16)** and **David Bowie tribute concert (13:29 - 15:14)** do not overlap.
3. **Avril Lavigne concert (17:25 - 18:25)** has no overlapping events.

Given the priorities and constraints, we will exclude the Silent disco party and prioritize the Avril Lavigne concert. This allows us to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without any conflicts.

Final Schedule:
- Fireworks (09:45 - 10:45)
- Korean BBQ food trucks (12:16 - 13:16)
- David Bowie tribute concert (13:29 - 15:14)
- Avril Lavigne concert (17:25 - 18:25)
