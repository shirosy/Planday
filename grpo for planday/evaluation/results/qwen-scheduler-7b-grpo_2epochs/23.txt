To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, I'll first identify the critical events and then arrange them according to their absolute start times. Since "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" has the highest priority (weight = 2), it will take precedence over any other event that might overlap with it. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Preparing PTO handover** (00:27 - 01:27): This is a non-priority event and can be included as is.
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (04:14 - 05:29): This is a non-priority event and can be included as is.
3. **Client call with Acme Corp** (08:18 - 08:48): This is a non-priority event and can be included as is.
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick** (11:20 - 12:05): This is a high-priority event and must be scheduled without conflict.
5. **Q1 revenue report writing** (11:38 - 12:38): This event overlaps with the brainstorming session. Since it has lower priority, it should be excluded.
6. **Analyzing product performance** (16:27 - 16:57): This is a non-priority event and can be included as is.
7. **One-on-one with manager** (16:39 - 17:39): This event overlaps with the analyzing product performance session. Since it has lower priority, it should be excluded.

By following these steps, we ensure that the high-priority event is not conflicted and that no overlaps occur between events.
