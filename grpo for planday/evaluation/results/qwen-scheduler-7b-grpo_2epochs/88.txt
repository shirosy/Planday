First, let's analyze the events and their priorities:

1. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55)** - Weight = 2
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45)** - Weight = 1
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26)** - Weight = 1
4. **Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13)** - Weight = 2
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58)** - Weight = 1

Given that "Chess with Daniel" has the highest priority (Weight = 2), it should not be moved. However, "Meeting with Emma and Jake" also has a high priority (Weight = 2). 

We need to ensure that no overlaps occur and that we maximize the sum of weighted event durations. Let's evaluate the potential placements:

- If we keep both "Meeting with Emma and Jake" and "Chess with Daniel":
  - "Meeting with Emma and Jake" from 04:55 to 06:55
  - "Chess with Daniel" from 07:43 to 08:13
  
  This creates a conflict because "Chess with Daniel" starts at 07:43 while "Meeting with Emma and Jake" ends at 06:55.

Since there is a conflict between the two priority events, we must exclude one of them. Given that "Chess with Daniel" has a higher priority, we will exclude "Meeting with Emma and Jake".

Now, let's arrange the remaining events:

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45)** - Weight = 1
2. **Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26)** - Weight = 1
3. **Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13)** - Weight = 2
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58)** - Weight = 1

This arrangement avoids any conflicts and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
