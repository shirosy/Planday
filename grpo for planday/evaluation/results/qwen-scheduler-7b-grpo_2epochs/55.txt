To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, let's analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given criteria:

1. **Fireworks**: 02:00 - 03:00 (Weight = 1)
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass**: 10:01 - 11:01 (Weight = 2)
3. **Sum 41 concert**: 15:19 - 15:34 (Weight = 2)
4. **Korean BBQ food trucks**: 15:39 - 17:09 (Weight = 1)
5. **The Killers concert**: 16:51 - 18:51 (Weight = 1)

Given that the "Sum 41 concert" and "Backstage tour VIP pass" have the highest priority, we should try to include them in the schedule without overlapping. 

Let's consider the constraints:
- The "Sum 41 concert" starts at 15:19 and ends at 15:34.
- The "Korean BBQ food trucks" start at 15:39 and end at 17:09, which conflicts with the "Sum 41 concert."
- Therefore, we need to exclude the "Korean BBQ food trucks" to avoid overlap.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Fireworks**: 02:00 - 03:00 (Weight = 1)
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass**: 10:01 - 11:01 (Weight = 2)
3. **Sum 41 concert**: 15:19 - 15:34 (Weight = 2)
4. **The Killers concert**: 16:51 - 18:51 (Weight = 1)

This schedule respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
