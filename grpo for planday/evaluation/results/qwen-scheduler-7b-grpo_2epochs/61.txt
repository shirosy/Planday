To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure no overlaps. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36)**: Weight = 1
2. **The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38)**: Weight = 2
3. **Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59)**: Weight = 1
4. **David Guetta DJ set (19:50 - 20:50)**: Weight = 2
5. **Jam session (19:50 - 20:50)**: Weight = 1

Given priorities:
- David Guetta DJ set
- The Killers concert

We should try to include both priority events without overlap. Let's see how they fit into the schedule:

1. **Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36)**: This event is non-priority and starts early, so it should stay as is.
2. **The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38)**: This is a priority event and should be included.
3. **Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59)**: This event is non-priority and does not conflict with any other events, so it should stay as is.
4. **David Guetta DJ set (19:50 - 20:50)**: This is a priority event, but there is a conflict with the Jam session. Since the David Guetta DJ set has higher weight, we will include it and exclude the Jam session.

Final schedule:
- Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36)
- The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38)
- Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59)
- David Guetta DJ set (19:50 - 20:50)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
