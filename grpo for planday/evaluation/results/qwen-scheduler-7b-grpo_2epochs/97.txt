To create an optimized schedule that respects all the rules, we need to prioritize the group study for the physics test and ensure it doesn't overlap with any other events. Let's analyze the events and their constraints:

1. **Group study for physics test (05:08 - 05:23)** - This is a priority event.
2. **Quantum computing guest talk (06:57 - 07:27)** - Overlaps with the group study, so it cannot be included.
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture (12:31 - 14:31)** - Can be included as it does not conflict with the priority event.
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (13:08 - 13:53)** - Conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture, so it cannot be included.
5. **Researching in library (14:35 - 16:20)** - Conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture, so it cannot be included.
6. **Chemistry experiment (20:30 - 22:15)** - Can be included as it does not conflict with any other events.

Given these constraints, let's construct the schedule:

- **Group study for physics test**: 05:08 - 05:23
- **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 12:31 - 14:31
- **Chemistry experiment**: 20:30 - 22:15

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the rules.
