To create an optimized schedule that respects all constraints, I'll first identify the events and their priorities. Then, I'll ensure that no overlaps occur and that priority events take precedence over non-priority events when conflicts arise.

1. **Chess with Daniel**: 04:51 - 06:36 (Priority = 2)
2. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 08:20 - 10:05 (Weight = 1)
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 08:39 - 08:54 (Weight = 1)
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 11:30 - 11:45 (Weight = 1)
5. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 14:01 - 14:16 (Weight = 1)
6. **Office hours with Prof. Chen**: 14:01 - 15:46 (Priority = 2)
7. **Researching in library**: 19:40 - 19:55 (Weight = 1)

### Step-by-Step Scheduling:

1. **Chess with Daniel** from 04:51 - 06:36 (Priority).
2. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams** from 08:20 - 10:05 (Weight = 1). This fits without conflict.
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture** from 08:39 - 08:54 (Weight = 1). Conflicts with the calculus lecture, so exclude it.
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike** from 11:30 - 11:45 (Weight = 1). Fits without conflict.
5. **Quantum computing guest talk** from 14:01 - 14:16 (Weight = 1). Conflicts with office hours with Prof. Chen, so exclude it.
6. **Office hours with Prof. Chen** from 14:01 - 15:46 (Priority). Fits without conflict.
7. **Researching in library** from 19:40 - 19:55 (Weight = 1). Fits without conflict.

### Final Schedule:

- Chess with Daniel: 04:51 - 06:36
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 08:20 - 10:05
- Study session with Sarah and Mike: 11:30 - 11:45
- Office hours with Prof. Chen: 14:01 - 15:46
- Researching in library: 19:40 - 19:55

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
