To create an optimized schedule that respects all constraints and prioritizes the given events, I'll analyze the events' start and end times, their weights, and any potential conflicts.

1. **One-on-one with manager (00:37 - 02:07)**: This is a normal event with a weight of 1.
2. **Preparing PTO handover (01:20 - 03:20)**: This is a priority event with a weight of 2.
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (03:27 - 03:42)**: This event starts immediately after the PTO handover and ends before the next event. It has a weight of 1.
4. **Q1 revenue report writing (04:41 - 05:26)**: This event follows the marketing standup and has a weight of 1.
5. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:58 - 18:28)**: This is a normal event with a weight of 1.
6. **Analyzing product performance (21:05 - 21:50)**: This is a priority event with a weight of 2.

Given the constraints, we need to ensure that no events overlap and that priority events take precedence over normal events when there's a conflict. Let's go through the schedule step-by-step:

- From 00:37 to 02:07, we have the one-on-one with the manager.
- From 01:20 to 03:20, we have the high-priority "Preparing PTO handover."
- From 03:27 to 03:42, the marketing standup would normally fit here, but it conflicts with the PTO handover. Since the PTO handover has higher priority, we exclude the marketing standup.
- From 04:41 to 05:26, we have the Q1 revenue report writing.
- From 17:58 to 18:28, we have the brainstorming session.
- From 21:05 to 21:50, we have the high-priority "Analyzing product performance."

By following these steps, we ensure that the schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
