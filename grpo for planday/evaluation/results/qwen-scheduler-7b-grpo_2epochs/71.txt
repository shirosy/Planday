To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them accordingly. 

1. **Q1 Revenue Report Writing** (00:37 - 02:07) - Priority event (weight = 2)
2. **Marketing Standup on Zoom** (00:38 - 02:23) - Normal event (weight = 1)
3. **One-on-One with Manager** (09:43 - 10:58) - Normal event (weight = 1)
4. **Replying to Emails** (10:42 - 12:12) - Normal event (weight = 1)
5. **Meeting with Lisa at Café** (17:07 - 17:22) - Normal event (weight = 1)

Given that the marketing standup overlaps with the Q1 revenue report writing, we need to choose the one with the higher weight. Since Q1 revenue report writing has a higher weight (2), it will be included, and the marketing standup will be excluded.

The reply to emails also overlaps with the one-on-one with the manager. Again, since the Q1 revenue report writing has a higher weight, the one-on-one with the manager will be excluded.

Thus, the optimized schedule will only include the Q1 revenue report writing and the meeting with Lisa at the café.
