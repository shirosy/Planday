To create an optimized schedule that respects all the rules and prioritizes the given events, let's analyze the constraints and potential conflicts:

1. **Trying new VR headset (00:18 - 00:48)**: This event starts at 00:18 and ends at 00:48. It has a weight of 2.
2. **Small Language Models talk (03:08 - 04:38)**: This event starts at 03:08 and ends at 04:38. It has a weight of 1.
3. **Digital detox meditation session (08:12 - 09:12)**: This event starts at 08:12 and ends at 09:12. It has a weight of 2.
4. **AI keynote (10:57 - 12:42)**: This event starts at 10:57 and ends at 12:42. It has a weight of 1.
5. **Live coding on Rust (11:19 - 12:49)**: This event starts at 11:19 and ends at 12:49. It has a weight of 1.
6. **Networking with engineers (12:47 - 14:47)**: This event starts at 12:47 and ends at 14:47. It has a weight of 1.
7. **Web3 panel discussion (18:26 - 19:41)**: This event starts at 18:26 and ends at 19:41. It has a weight of 1.
8. **Async Python talk (21:06 - 23:06)**: This event starts at 21:06 and ends at 23:06. It has a weight of 1.

### Prioritization:
- **Trying new VR headset**: Weight = 2
- **Digital detox meditation session**: Weight = 2

### Conflict Analysis:
- There are no direct time conflicts between any of the events listed.
- The only potential conflict arises when considering the overlap between "Live coding on Rust" (11:19 - 12:49) and "Networking with engineers" (12:47 - 14:47). Since both have a weight of 1, we need to decide which one to keep.

### Decision:
- We will exclude "Networking with engineers" (12:47 - 14:47) because it does not align with the priorities and would result in a lower total weighted duration.

### Final Schedule:
- **Trying new VR headset (00:18 - 00:48)**
- **Small Language Models talk (03:08 - 04:38)**
- **Digital detox meditation session (08:12 - 09:12)**
- **AI keynote (10:57 - 12:42)**
- **Live coding on Rust (11:19 - 12:49)**
- **Web3 panel discussion (18:26 - 19:41)**
- **Async Python talk (21:06 - 23:06)**

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the given rules and prioritizing the specified events.
