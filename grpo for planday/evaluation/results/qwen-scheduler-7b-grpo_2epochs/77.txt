First, I'll list all events along with their priorities:

1. Live coding on Rust (00:23 - 01:23) - Weight: 1
2. Digital detox meditation session (00:59 - 01:44) - Weight: 1
3. Trying new VR headset (02:18 - 03:33) - Weight: 1
4. Drone building hackathon (04:38 - 06:38) - Weight: 1
5. Small Language Models talk (11:03 - 11:18) - Weight: 1
6. Networking with engineers (11:32 - 13:32) - Weight: 2
7. AI keynote (11:39 - 13:24) - Weight: 2
8. Web3 panel discussion (18:19 - 19:49) - Weight: 1

Next, I'll consider the constraints and priorities:

- The AI keynote and Networking with engineers have higher weights.
- There should be no overlaps between events.
- Events with higher weights take precedence over those with lower weights in case of conflicts.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Live coding on Rust (00:23 - 01:23)** - Weight: 1
2. **Digital detox meditation session (00:59 - 01:44)** - Weight: 1
3. **Trying new VR headset (02:18 - 03:33)** - Weight: 1
4. **Drone building hackathon (04:38 - 06:38)** - Weight: 1
5. **Small Language Models talk (11:03 - 11:18)** - Weight: 1
6. **Networking with engineers (11:32 - 13:32)** - Weight: 2 (Conflicts with AI keynote)
   - Since the AI keynote (11:39 - 13:24) has a higher weight, we exclude the networking event.
7. **AI keynote (11:39 - 13:24)** - Weight: 2
8. **Web3 panel discussion (18:19 - 19:49)** - Weight: 1

This schedule respects all constraints and prioritizes the events as required.
