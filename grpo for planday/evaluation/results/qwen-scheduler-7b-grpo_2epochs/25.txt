To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to carefully consider the priorities and non-overlapping requirements. Let's break down the events and prioritize them:

1. **Avril Lavigne concert (15:07 - 16:37)**: This is a normal event with weight = 1.
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass (16:49 - 17:34)**: This is a priority event with weight = 2.
3. **Silent disco party (17:32 - 19:17)**: This is a normal event with weight = 1.
4. **Fireworks (17:59 - 18:44)**: This is a normal event with weight = 1.
5. **Jam session (19:29 - 20:29)**: This is a priority event with weight = 2.
6. **David Guetta DJ set (21:53 - 22:53)**: This is a normal event with weight = 1.

Given that the Backstage tour VIP pass and Jam session have higher weights, we should try to fit them into the schedule without causing any conflicts. 

Let's analyze the possible placements:
- The Backstage tour VIP pass starts at 16:49 and ends at 17:34. It will conflict with the Silent disco party which also starts at 17:32.
- The Jam session starts at 19:29 and ends at 20:29. It will conflict with the David Guetta DJ set which also starts at 21:53.

Since there are no overlapping slots available for both the Backstage tour VIP pass and the Jam session, we need to choose one of them. Given that both have equal priority, we can choose either one. Let's choose the Jam session as it has a later start time and might offer more flexibility.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Avril Lavigne concert (15:07 - 16:37)**: Normal event
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass (16:49 - 17:34)**: Priority event
3. **Fireworks (17:59 - 18:44)**: Normal event
4. **Jam session (19:29 - 20:29)**: Priority event
5. **David Guetta DJ set (21:53 - 22:53)**: Normal event

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
