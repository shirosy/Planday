To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize accordingly.

1. **Async Python talk** (05:46 - 07:46): Weight = 1
2. **Live coding on Rust** (06:39 - 08:09): Weight = 1
3. **AI keynote** (11:39 - 12:24): Weight = 1
4. **3D printing workshop** (15:34 - 17:34): Weight = 1
5. **Trying new VR headset** (16:47 - 17:17): Weight = 2

Given the priorities and the need to avoid overlaps, let's evaluate the potential schedules:

### Initial Schedule without Prioritization:
- 05:46 - 07:46: Async Python talk
- 06:39 - 08:09: Live coding on Rust
- 11:39 - 12:24: AI keynote
- 15:34 - 17:34: 3D printing workshop
- 16:47 - 17:17: Trying new VR headset

### Analysis:
- The live coding on Rust overlaps with the trying new VR headset from 06:39 to 08:09. Since the trying new VR headset has a higher priority, we need to exclude the overlapping part.
- We should also consider if excluding any other event would help maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

### Optimized Schedule:
1. **Async Python talk** (05:46 - 07:46): Weight = 1
2. **Live coding on Rust** (08:09 - 08:09): This is just a placeholder since it's fully covered by the next event.
3. **AI keynote** (11:39 - 12:24): Weight = 1
4. **3D printing workshop** (15:34 - 17:34): Weight = 1
5. **Trying new VR headset** (16:47 - 17:17): Weight = 2

By excluding the overlapping part of the live coding session and ensuring the trying new VR headset is included, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
