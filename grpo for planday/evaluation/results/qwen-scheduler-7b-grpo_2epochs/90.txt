To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and ensure they are included in the schedule.
2. Place the non-priority events in chronological order, ensuring no overlaps and maximizing their inclusion.
3. Remove any conflicting events that cannot be accommodated without violating the rules.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Priority Events:**
   - Marketing standup on Zoom (20:36 - 21:06) [Weight = 2]
   - Analyzing product performance (12:12 - 13:42) [Weight = 2]

2. **Non-Priority Events:**
   - Meeting with Lisa at café (02:40 - 04:40) [Weight = 1]
   - Client call with Acme Corp (04:47 - 05:17) [Weight = 1]
   - One-on-one with manager (08:26 - 10:26) [Weight = 1]
   - Preparing PTO handover (13:21 - 13:51) [Weight = 1]
   - Updating website content (15:29 - 15:44) [Weight = 1]

3. **Placement Strategy:**
   - Start with the earliest event and proceed chronologically.
   - Ensure that priority events are placed before non-priority events if necessary.
   - If there are conflicts, choose the event with the higher weight.

**Schedule Construction:**

- **Meeting with Lisa at café (02:40 - 04:40)** [Weight = 1]
- **Client call with Acme Corp (04:47 - 05:17)** [Weight = 1] - Conflicts with the priority event "Analyzing product performance". Exclude this event.
- **One-on-one with manager (08:26 - 10:26)** [Weight = 1]
- **Analyzing product performance (12:12 - 13:42)** [Weight = 2]
- **Preparing PTO handover (13:21 - 13:51)** [Weight = 1] - Conflicts with the priority event "Preparing PTO handover" (13:21 - 13:51). Exclude this event.
- **Marketing standup on Zoom (20:36 - 21:06)** [Weight = 2]

**Final Schedule:**

- Meeting with Lisa at café (02:40 - 04:40)
- One-on-one with manager (08:26 - 10:26)
- Analyzing product performance (12:12 - 13:42)
- Marketing standup on Zoom (20:36 - 21:06)
