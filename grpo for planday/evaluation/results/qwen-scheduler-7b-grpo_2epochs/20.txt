To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The priority events are "Preparing PTO handover" and "Replying to emails".
2. **Check Overlaps**: Ensure that no two events overlap, especially between priority events.
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: Prioritize including longer events and ensure that priority events are included whenever possible without causing overlaps.

Let's analyze the events and their constraints:

- **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:29 - 02:29): Normal event
- **Replying to emails** (01:37 - 03:22): Priority event
- **Client call with Acme Corp** (03:35 - 04:20): Normal event
- **Preparing PTO handover** (03:57 - 05:27): Priority event
- **One-on-one with manager** (12:01 - 13:46): Normal event
- **Analyzing product performance** (19:01 - 21:01): Normal event

### Step-by-Step Schedule Creation

1. **Q1 Revenue Report Writing** (00:29 - 02:29): Start the day with this normal event.
2. **Replying to Emails** (01:37 - 03:22): This is a priority event. It starts after Q1 revenue report writing and ends before the client call.
3. **Client Call with Acme Corp** (03:35 - 04:20): This normal event overlaps with "Preparing PTO Handover". Since "Preparing PTO Handover" has higher priority, we exclude this event.
4. **Preparing PTO Handover** (03:57 - 05:27): This is a priority event and it fits perfectly after "Replying to Emails".
5. **One-on-One with Manager** (12:01 - 13:46): This normal event fits well in the middle of the day.
6. **Analyzing Product Performance** (19:01 - 21:01): This normal event fits at the end of the day.

By following these steps, we ensure that the highest-priority events are included and that there are no overlaps.
