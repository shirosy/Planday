To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, let's analyze the events and prioritize the "Preparing PTO handover" event as it has a higher weight.

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom**: This event starts at 06:24 and ends at 06:39. It is a normal event with a duration of 15 minutes.
2. **Replying to emails**: This event starts at 13:52 and ends at 15:37. It is a normal event with a duration of 85 minutes.
3. **Preparing PTO handover**: This event starts at 14:18 and ends at 15:48. It is a priority event with a duration of 90 minutes.
4. **Meeting with Lisa at café**: This event starts at 16:57 and ends at 18:57. It is a normal event with a duration of 120 minutes.

Given that the "Preparing PTO handover" event has a higher priority and starts at 14:18, it should not overlap with any other event. Let's see how we can fit everything into the schedule:

- The marketing standup ends at 06:39, so it doesn't conflict with any other events.
- The replying to emails event starts at 13:52 and ends at 15:37, which includes part of the "Preparing PTO handover" event from 14:18 to 15:37. Since the replying to emails event has a lower priority, it will be excluded to make room for the "Preparing PTO handover".
- The "Preparing PTO handover" event starts at 14:18 and ends at 15:48, which fits perfectly without overlapping with any other events.
- The meeting with Lisa at café starts at 16:57 and ends at 18:57, which also fits without overlapping with any other events.

By excluding the "Replying to emails" event, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
