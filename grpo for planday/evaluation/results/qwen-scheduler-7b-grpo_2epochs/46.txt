To optimize the schedule while respecting all the given constraints, we need to prioritize the "AI keynote" and ensure it does not overlap with any other event. Let's analyze the events and see how we can fit everything in:

1. **Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00)**
   - This event starts at 01:15 and ends at 02:00. It has a weight of 1.

2. **Trying new VR headset (01:40 - 02:10)**
   - This event starts at 01:40 and ends at 02:10. It has a weight of 1.
   - Overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00).

3. **Async Python talk (05:30 - 06:45)**
   - This event starts at 05:30 and ends at 06:45. It has a weight of 1.

4. **AI keynote (06:18 - 07:03)**
   - This event starts at 06:18 and ends at 07:03. It has a weight of 2.
   - Conflicts with the Async Python talk (05:30 - 06:45).
   - Since the AI keynote has a higher weight, we will exclude the Async Python talk.

5. **Networking with engineers (20:35 - 21:50)**
   - This event starts at 20:35 and ends at 21:50. It has a weight of 1.

Given these constraints, the optimal schedule would be:

- Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00)
- Networking with engineers (20:35 - 21:50)

The AI keynote cannot be included because it conflicts with another event, and trying to fit it would require excluding another high-weight event to avoid overlapping.
