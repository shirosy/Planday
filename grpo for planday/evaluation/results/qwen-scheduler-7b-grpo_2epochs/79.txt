To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, let's analyze the events and prioritize them:

1. **Small Language Models talk** (07:45 - 09:15): This is a priority event with a duration of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
2. **Web3 panel discussion** (11:42 - 12:27): This has a duration of 45 minutes.
3. **3D printing workshop** (12:17 - 13:17): This has a duration of 60 minutes.
4. **Live coding on Rust** (13:38 - 15:38): This has a duration of 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Given that the "Small Language Models talk" is prioritized, we should try to fit it into the schedule first. However, it starts at 07:45, which might conflict with other events if we don't plan carefully.

Let's consider the following sequence:
- Start with the "Small Language Models talk" from 07:45 to 09:15.
- After the "Small Language Models talk," there's a gap until 11:42, so we can fit the "Web3 panel discussion" from 11:42 to 12:27.
- The "3D printing workshop" from 12:17 to 13:17 would overlap with the "Web3 panel discussion." Therefore, we need to exclude one of these. Since the "3D printing workshop" has a lower priority, we will exclude it.
- Finally, we can fit the "Live coding on Rust" from 13:38 to 15:38.

This sequence maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps and respects the chronological order.
