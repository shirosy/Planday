To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to carefully consider the priorities and non-overlapping requirements. Let's break down the steps:

1. **List all events with their start and end times**:
   - Researching in library (02:20 - 03:20)
   - Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17)
   - Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12)
   - Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31)
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (19:13 - 19:43)

2. **Identify priority events**:
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight = 2)
   - Researching in library (weight = 2)

3. **Maximize the sum of weighted event durations**:
   - Both priority events have equal weight, so we should try to fit both into the schedule without overlapping other events.

4. **Check for conflicts and overlaps**:
   - Researching in library (02:20 - 03:20) does not conflict with any other events.
   - Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17) does not conflict with any other events.
   - Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12) does not conflict with any other events.
   - Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31) conflicts with the study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18). We need to choose one.
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18) conflicts with the group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31). We need to choose one.
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (19:13 - 19:43) does not conflict with any other events.

5. **Decide which conflicting events to exclude**:
   - Since both group study sessions and study sessions have the same duration and priority, we can exclude either. Let's exclude the group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31).

6. **Final schedule**:
   - Researching in library (02:20 - 03:20)
   - Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17)
   - Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12)
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (19:13 - 19:43)

This schedule respects the chronological order, prioritizes the events, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
