To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and ensure they are included in the schedule.
2. Place the priority events in their absolute start and end times.
3. Schedule other events around the priority events, ensuring no overlaps and respecting the chronological order.
4. Calculate the total weighted duration of the scheduled events.

Given events and priorities:
- Priority event: Shopping at farmer's market (21:05 - 21:35)
- Other events: 
  - Planting flowers in the garden (03:11 - 03:26)
  - Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)
  - Cooking pasta (04:34 - 05:04)
  - Walking with Bella (14:14 - 14:59)
  - Yoga class with Emily (17:58 - 18:43)

Let's place the priority event first and then see how we can fit the others around it.

1. **Shopping at farmer's market (21:05 - 21:35)** (Priority event, weight = 2)
   - This event cannot be moved or shortened.

2. **Planting flowers in the garden (03:11 - 03:26)** (Weight = 1)
   - This event can be placed before any other event as long as it doesn't overlap with another event.

3. **Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)** (Weight = 1)
   - This event starts after planting flowers and ends before cooking pasta, so it fits well between them.

4. **Cooking pasta (04:34 - 05:04)** (Weight = 1)
   - This event overlaps with jogging at the park, so we need to exclude one of them. Since jogging at the park has a higher weight, we exclude cooking pasta.

5. **Walking with Bella (14:14 - 14:59)** (Weight = 1)
   - This event can be placed after yoga class with Emily.

6. **Yoga class with Emily (17:58 - 18:43)** (Weight = 1)
   - This event can be placed before walking with Bella.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

- Planting flowers in the garden (03:11 - 03:26)
- Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)
- Walking with Bella (14:14 - 14:59)
- Yoga class with Emily (17:58 - 18:43)
- Shopping at farmer's market (21:05 - 21:35)

This schedule respects the chronological order, includes the priority event, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
