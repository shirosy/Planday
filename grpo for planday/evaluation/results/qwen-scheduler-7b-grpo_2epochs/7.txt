To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their absolute start and end times.
2. Place the priority events first in the schedule to ensure they do not overlap with other events.
3. Check for any conflicts between events and resolve them by including the event with the higher weighted time.
4. If necessary, exclude non-priority events to avoid overlaps and maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Given the events and priorities:
- Digital detox meditation session (01:20 - 02:35)
- Web3 panel discussion (05:56 - 06:26)
- Live coding on Rust (13:34 - 15:34)
- 3D printing workshop (13:49 - 14:34)

The priority event is the 3D printing workshop (13:49 - 14:34). This event should be placed as early as possible without overlapping with other events.

Let's analyze the potential placements:

1. **Digital detox meditation session (01:20 - 02:35)**: This event does not conflict with any priority events.
2. **Web3 panel discussion (05:56 - 06:26)**: This event does not conflict with any priority events.
3. **Live coding on Rust (13:34 - 15:34)**: This event conflicts with the 3D printing workshop (13:49 - 14:34). Since the 3D printing workshop has higher priority, we must exclude the live coding on Rust.

By excluding the live coding on Rust, we can fit the 3D printing workshop into the schedule without any conflicts.

Final Schedule:
- Digital detox meditation session (01:20 - 02:35)
- Web3 panel discussion (05:56 - 06:26)
- 3D printing workshop (13:49 - 14:34)

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
