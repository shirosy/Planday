To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them according to their weights. 

First, let's list the events and their priorities:
1. Shopping at farmer's market (01:40 - 03:40) - Weight = 1
2. Cooking pasta (03:23 - 04:08) - Weight = 1
3. Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:46 - 08:46) - Weight = 1
4. Walking with Bella (08:28 - 09:28) - Weight = 1
5. Reading 'Dune' (09:59 - 10:29) - Weight = 1
6. Planting flowers in the garden (14:09 - 15:54) - Weight = 1
7. Calling Mom and Dad (18:03 - 20:03) - Weight = 2

Since "Calling Mom and Dad" has the highest priority, it should be included in the schedule regardless of any conflicts. Let's see how we can fit the other events around it.

### Initial Schedule Attempt
1. Shopping at farmer's market (01:40 - 03:40)
2. Cooking pasta (03:23 - 04:08) - Conflict with Shopping at farmer's market
3. Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:46 - 08:46)
4. Walking with Bella (08:28 - 09:28) - Conflict with Deep cleaning the kitchen
5. Reading 'Dune' (09:59 - 10:29) - Conflict with Walking with Bella
6. Planting flowers in the garden (14:09 - 15:54)
7. Calling Mom and Dad (18:03 - 20:03)

### Adjustments
- Remove "Cooking pasta" as it conflicts with "Shopping at farmer's market".
- Remove "Walking with Bella" and "Reading 'Dune'" as they conflict with each other and with "Deep cleaning the kitchen".

### Final Schedule
1. Shopping at farmer's market (01:40 - 03:40)
2. Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:46 - 08:46)
3. Planting flowers in the garden (14:09 - 15:54)
4. Calling Mom and Dad (18:03 - 20:03)

This schedule respects the priority of "Calling Mom and Dad" and includes all possible events without overlapping.
