To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, I need to carefully consider the constraints and prioritize the events. The key points to remember are:

1. **Chronological Order**: Events must remain in their original order.
2. **Weighted Durations**: Priority events (weight = 2) have more importance.
3. **No Overlaps**: Conflicts between events should favor the higher-weighted event.
4. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: We want to maximize the total duration of included events, considering both weights.

Given that "Small Language Models talk" has a higher priority (weight = 2), we need to ensure it doesn't conflict with other events. Let's analyze the potential conflicts:

- **Networking with engineers (03:18 - 03:33)** and **Small Language Models talk (03:27 - 04:57)** overlap from 03:27 to 03:33. Since "Small Language Models talk" has a higher priority, we will exclude "Networking with engineers".
- **Async Python talk (06:12 - 08:12)** and **3D printing workshop (08:30 - 09:00)** do not overlap.
- **Drone building hackathon (12:37 - 13:07)** and **Live coding on Rust (16:08 - 17:53)** do not overlap.
- **AI keynote (19:20 - 20:50)** and no other events overlap.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Small Language Models talk (03:27 - 04:57)**
2. **Async Python talk (06:12 - 08:12)**
3. **3D printing workshop (08:30 - 09:00)**
4. **Drone building hackathon (12:37 - 13:07)**
5. **Live coding on Rust (16:08 - 17:53)**
6. **AI keynote (19:20 - 20:50)**

This schedule respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
