To create an optimized schedule that respects all constraints, we need to carefully prioritize and arrange the events while ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations. Let's go through the steps:

1. **List Events with Weights**:
   - Chess with Daniel: 05:34 - 06:49 (weight = 1)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 05:45 - 06:30 (weight = 1)
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike: 08:03 - 09:48 (weight = 2)
   - Researching in library: 08:28 - 09:13 (weight = 1)
   - Group study for physics test: 10:38 - 11:53 (weight = 1)
   - Chemistry experiment: 15:28 - 17:13 (weight = 2)
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake: 16:41 - 17:41 (weight = 2)
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen: 19:36 - 19:51 (weight = 1)

2. **Identify Conflicts and Prioritize**:
   - **Chemistry experiment**: 15:28 - 17:13 (weight = 2)
   - **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 16:41 - 17:41 (weight = 2)
     - These two events overlap, so we must choose the one with the higher weight. Both have weight 2, so we'll keep both as per the rule of including the event with higher weight.
   - **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 08:03 - 09:48 (weight = 2)
     - This event overlaps with "Researching in library": 08:28 - 09:13 (weight = 1). Since "Study session with Sarah and Mike" has higher weight, we exclude "Researching in library".
   - **Group study for physics test**: 10:38 - 11:53 (weight = 1)
     - This event does not conflict with any other event, so it remains.

3. **Final Schedule**:
   - Chess with Daniel: 05:34 - 06:49
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 05:45 - 06:30
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike: 08:03 - 09:48
   - Chemistry experiment: 15:28 - 17:13
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake: 16:41 - 17:41
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen: 19:36 - 19:51

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.
