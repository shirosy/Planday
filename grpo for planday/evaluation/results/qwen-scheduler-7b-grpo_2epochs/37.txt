To create an optimized schedule, I'll first identify the priority events and then arrange them while respecting their absolute start and end times. I'll also ensure that no overlaps occur and that the total weighted duration is maximized.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Web3 panel discussion (10:27 - 12:12)**: This is a high-priority event.
2. **Live coding on Rust (11:28 - 12:58)**: This is another high-priority event.
3. **Trying new VR headset (09:16 - 10:16)**: This event starts before the Web3 panel discussion but ends before the Live coding session. It should be included as it doesn't conflict with the high-priority events.
4. **Drone building hackathon (20:32 - 22:02)**: This event does not conflict with any other events and can be included.
5. **AI keynote (21:19 - 22:19)**: This event conflicts with the Drone building hackathon. Since the AI keynote has higher priority, the hackathon will be excluded.

**Final Schedule:**
- Trying new VR headset (09:16 - 10:16) [Weight: 1]
- Web3 panel discussion (10:27 - 12:12) [Weight: 2]
- Live coding on Rust (11:28 - 12:58) [Weight: 2]
- AI keynote (21:19 - 22:19) [Weight: 2]

The total weighted duration is calculated as follows:
- Trying new VR headset: 1 hour * 1 = 1
- Web3 panel discussion: 1 hour 45 minutes * 2 = 3.75
- Live coding on Rust: 1 hour 30 minutes * 2 = 3
- AI keynote: 1 hour 20 minutes * 2 = 2.4

Total: 1 + 3.75 + 3 + 2.4 = 10.15 hours

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
