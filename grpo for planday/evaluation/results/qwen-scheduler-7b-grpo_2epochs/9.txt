To create an optimized schedule that respects all constraints, we need to carefully consider the overlap between events and prioritize the events based on their weights. Let's analyze the given events and priorities:

1. **3D printing workshop (01:17 - 01:47)** - Weight: 1
2. **Trying new VR headset (09:48 - 11:03)** - Weight: 2
3. **Drone building hackathon (11:04 - 11:19)** - Weight: 1
4. **Live coding on Rust (11:14 - 11:44)** - Weight: 2
5. **Async Python talk (19:41 - 20:11)** - Weight: 1
6. **AI keynote (20:26 - 22:26)** - Weight: 1
7. **Networking with engineers (22:12 - 23:42)** - Weight: 1

Given the priorities:
- Trying new VR headset
- Live coding on Rust

We should ensure these two events are included in the schedule. However, we need to check for conflicts and decide whether to exclude other events.

### Analysis:
1. **3D printing workshop** (01:17 - 01:47): No conflict with any prioritized events.
2. **Trying new VR headset** (09:48 - 11:03): Prioritized event.
3. **Drone building hackathon** (11:04 - 11:19): Conflicts with **Live coding on Rust** (11:14 - 11:44). Since **Live coding on Rust** has higher priority, we exclude **Drone building hackathon**.
4. **Live coding on Rust** (11:14 - 11:44): Prioritized event.
5. **Async Python talk** (19:41 - 20:11): No conflict with any prioritized events.
6. **AI keynote** (20:26 - 22:26): Conflicts with **Async Python talk** (19:41 - 20:11). Since **Async Python talk** has higher priority, we exclude **AI keynote**.
7. **Networking with engineers** (22:12 - 23:42): No conflict with any prioritized events.

### Final Schedule:
- **3D printing workshop**: 01:17 - 01:47
- **Trying new VR headset**: 09:48 - 11:03
- **Live coding on Rust**: 11:14 - 11:44
- **Async Python talk**: 19:41 - 20:11
- **Networking with engineers**: 22:12 - 23:42

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
