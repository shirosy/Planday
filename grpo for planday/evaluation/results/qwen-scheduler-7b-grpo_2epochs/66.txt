To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. **List all events with their weights**:
   - Watching 'Inception': Start 01:27, End 02:57, Weight 1
   - Cooking pasta: Start 07:18, End 07:33, Weight 2
   - Planting flowers in the garden: Start 11:25, End 12:40, Weight 1
   - Shopping at farmer's market: Start 12:53, End 14:08, Weight 1
   - Reading 'Dune': Start 13:02, End 13:17, Weight 1
   - Walking with Bella: Start 13:19, End 15:04, Weight 1
   - Yoga class with Emily: Start 15:45, End 17:15, Weight 1
   - Jogging at the park: Start 16:54, End 17:09, Weight 1

2. **Identify conflicts**:
   - The cooking pasta event (07:18 - 07:33) does not conflict with any other event.
   - The jogging at the park (16:54 - 17:09) conflicts with the yoga class with Emily (15:45 - 17:15).

3. **Resolve conflicts**:
   - Since the jogging at the park has a lower weight (1) compared to the yoga class (1), we exclude the jogging at the park.

4. **Re-evaluate the schedule**:
   - Remove the jogging at the park event from the list.

5. **Calculate the total weighted duration**:
   - Watching 'Inception': 1 hour 30 minutes * 1 = 1.5 hours
   - Cooking pasta: 15 minutes * 2 = 0.3 hours
   - Planting flowers in the garden: 1 hour 15 minutes * 1 = 1.25 hours
   - Shopping at farmer's market: 1 hour 15 minutes * 1 = 1.25 hours
   - Reading 'Dune': 15 minutes * 1 = 0.25 hours
   - Walking with Bella: 1 hour 45 minutes * 1 = 1.75 hours
   - Yoga class with Emily: 1 hour 30 minutes * 1 = 1.5 hours

   Total weighted duration = 1.5 + 0.3 + 1.25 + 1.25 + 0.25 + 1.75 + 1.5 = 8.25 hours

6. **Final schedule**:
   - Ensure the schedule respects the original absolute start and end times and follows the chronological order.
