To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to prioritize the events that have higher weights and ensure there are no overlaps. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 01:40 - 03:40
   - Weight: 1

2. **Chess with Daniel**: 03:38 - 04:38
   - Weight: 2

3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 10:12 - 11:57
   - Weight: 1

4. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 10:18 - 11:18
   - Weight: 1

5. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 13:30 - 14:45
   - Weight: 2

6. **Researching in library**: 19:37 - 20:52
   - Weight: 1

Given the priorities:
- Chess with Daniel (03:38 - 04:38)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (13:30 - 14:45)

We need to ensure these events are included in the schedule without overlap. Let's build the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 01:40 - 03:40
   - This event cannot be moved or changed.

2. **Chess with Daniel**: 03:38 - 04:38
   - This event has high priority and must be included.

3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 10:12 - 11:57
   - This event has low priority and could potentially conflict with the meeting with Emma and Jake.

4. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 10:18 - 11:18
   - This event also has low priority and could conflict with the study session.

Since both the study session and the meeting have low priority and could conflict, we should exclude one of them to maximize the sum of weighted event durations. Given the conflicting times, excluding the meeting with Emma and Jake would allow us to keep the study session.

5. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 13:30 - 14:45
   - This event has high priority and must be included.

6. **Researching in library**: 19:37 - 20:52
   - This event has low priority and does not conflict with any other high-priority events.

Therefore, the optimized schedule is:
