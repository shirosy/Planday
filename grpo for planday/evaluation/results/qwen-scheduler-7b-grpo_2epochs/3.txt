To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to prioritize the "Fireworks" event and ensure that no other event overlaps with it. Additionally, we should maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Conflicts**: Check for any time conflicts between the "Fireworks" event and other events.
2. **Exclude Overlapping Events**: Remove overlapping events to avoid conflicts.
3. **Maximize Weighted Durations**: Ensure that the remaining events have the highest possible combined duration, considering their weights.

Let's analyze the events:

- **Fireworks**: 00:14 - 01:44 (Weight = 2)
- **David Guetta DJ set**: 03:01 - 04:16 (Weight = 1)
- **Silent disco party**: 10:15 - 12:00 (Weight = 1)
- **Jam session**: 10:46 - 12:46 (Weight = 1)
- **Sum 41 concert**: 11:00 - 13:00 (Weight = 1)
- **The Killers concert**: 13:15 - 13:45 (Weight = 1)
- **Korean BBQ food trucks**: 19:05 - 21:05 (Weight = 1)
- **Backstage tour VIP pass**: 21:56 - 23:41 (Weight = 1)

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Fireworks (00:14 - 01:44)**:
   - This event is already prioritized and cannot be moved or removed.

2. **David Guetta DJ set (03:01 - 04:16)**:
   - This event does not conflict with the "Fireworks" event.

3. **Silent disco party (10:15 - 12:00)**:
   - This event conflicts with the "Jam session" (10:46 - 12:46). We need to choose one of them.
   - Since both have the same weight, we can exclude one. Let's exclude the "Jam session".

4. **Sum 41 concert (11:00 - 13:00)**:
   - This event conflicts with the "The Killers concert" (13:15 - 13:45). We need to choose one of them.
   - Since both have the same weight, we can exclude one. Let's exclude the "The Killers concert".

5. **Korean BBQ food trucks (19:05 - 21:05)**:
   - This event does not conflict with the "Fireworks" event.

6. **Backstage tour VIP pass (21:56 - 23:41)**:
   - This event does not conflict with the "Fireworks" event.

### Final Schedule

By following these steps, we can create an optimized schedule:

- **Fireworks**: 00:14 - 01:44 (Weight = 2)
- **David Guetta DJ set**: 03:01 - 04:16 (Weight = 1)
- **Silent disco party**: 10:15 - 12:00 (Weight = 1) [Excluded]
- **Sum 41 concert**: 11:00 - 13:00 (Weight = 1) [Excluded]
- **Korean BBQ food trucks**: 19:05 - 21:05 (Weight = 1)
- **Backstage tour VIP pass**: 21:56 - 23:41 (Weight = 1)
