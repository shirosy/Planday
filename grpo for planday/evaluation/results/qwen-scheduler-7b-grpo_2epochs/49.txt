To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, I need to carefully consider the start and end times of each event and ensure that no overlaps occur. The priority event "Deep cleaning the kitchen" (15:40 - 16:40) must be included as it has the highest weight.

Let's analyze the events:

1. **Cooking pasta (02:12 - 02:27)**: This event overlaps with the shopping event (02:23 - 02:38). Since the cooking event starts before the shopping event and ends before it, we should exclude the cooking event to avoid overlap.

2. **Shopping at farmer's market (02:23 - 02:38)**: As mentioned, this event overlaps with the cooking event and should be excluded.

3. **Calling Mom and Dad (06:02 - 08:02)**: This event does not overlap with any other event and can be included.

4. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:40 - 16:40)**: This is the priority event and must be included.

5. **Watching 'Inception' (20:37 - 22:07)**: This event does not overlap with any other event and can be included.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

- **Calling Mom and Dad (06:02 - 08:02)**
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:40 - 16:40)**
- **Watching 'Inception' (20:37 - 22:07)**

This schedule respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
