To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, we need to carefully consider the start and end times of each event and prioritize those with higher weights.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List Events**: 
   - Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40)
   - Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58)
   - Drone building hackathon (05:59 - 06:59)
   - 3D printing workshop (12:08 - 12:23)
   - Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04)

2. **Prioritize Events**:
   - Highest priority: Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04, weight = 2)
   - Second highest priority: Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58, weight = 2)

3. **Check Overlaps**:
   - Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40) does not overlap with any high-priority events.
   - Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58) overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40). Since Live coding on Rust has a higher priority, it should replace the Web3 panel discussion.
   - Drone building hackathon (05:59 - 06:59) does not overlap with any high-priority events.
   - 3D printing workshop (12:08 - 12:23) does not overlap with any high-priority events.
   - Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04) does not overlap with any other events.

4. **Construct Schedule**:
   - Include the live coding on Rust event instead of the Web3 panel discussion.
   - Include all other events as they do not conflict with high-priority events.

Final Schedule:
- Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40) [excluded]
- Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58)
- Drone building hackathon (05:59 - 06:59)
- 3D printing workshop (12:08 - 12:23)
- Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04)
