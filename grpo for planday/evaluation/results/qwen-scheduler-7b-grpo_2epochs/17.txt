To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, let's analyze the events and prioritize them:

1. **One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45)** - Weight = 1
2. **Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42)** - Weight = 1
3. **Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37)** - Weight = 2
4. **Preparing PTO handover (20:32 - 20:47)** - Weight = 1

The client call with Acme Corp has the highest priority (weight = 2). However, it conflicts with the preparing PTO handover (20:32 - 20:47).

Given that the client call is prioritized and must not overlap, we need to exclude the PTO handover to avoid conflict. 

Now, let's arrange the remaining events:

1. **One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45)** - Weight = 1
2. **Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42)** - Weight = 1
3. **Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37)** - Weight = 2

This arrangement respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
