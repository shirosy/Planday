To create an optimized schedule that respects the given rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them according to their weights. Since "Meeting with Lisa at café" has the highest priority (weight = 2), it should not be moved or excluded.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Meeting with Lisa at café**: This event starts at 00:21 and ends at 01:21. It is a priority event, so it will always be included.

2. **Updating website content**: This event starts at 01:22 and ends at 02:22. It does not conflict with the meeting with Lisa, so it can be included.

3. **Q1 revenue report writing**: This event starts at 09:01 and ends at 10:31. It does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

4. **Replying to emails**: This event starts at 16:06 and ends at 16:51. It does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

5. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick**: This event starts at 17:25 and ends at 17:55. It conflicts with the one-on-one with the manager, which also starts at 17:32 and ends at 18:17. Since brainstorming has a lower weight (weight = 1), we exclude it.

6. **One-on-one with manager**: This event starts at 17:32 and ends at 18:17. It conflicts with the brainstorming session, which we have already excluded. Therefore, this event can be included.

7. **Preparing PTO handover**: This event starts at 20:07 and ends at 21:22. It does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

8. **Analyzing product performance**: This event starts at 21:19 and ends at 22:04. It conflicts with the preparing PTO handover, which also starts at 20:07 and ends at 21:22. Since analyzing product performance has a lower weight (weight = 1), we exclude it.

Based on this analysis, the optimized schedule would be:
