To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the "Marketing standup on Zoom" event due to its high weight (2). We should then fit the other events around it while respecting their absolute start and end times and avoiding any overlaps.

Here's the initial arrangement considering the constraints:

1. **Analyzing product performance** (01:11 - 01:56)
2. **Client call with Acme Corp** (06:34 - 07:19)
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (14:51 - 15:51)
4. **Q1 revenue report writing** (15:19 - 16:04)

However, there is a conflict between the "Marketing standup on Zoom" and the "Q1 revenue report writing" events because both occupy the same slot from 15:19 to 16:04. Since the "Marketing standup on Zoom" has a higher weight, we will exclude the "Q1 revenue report writing" event.

Final Schedule:
1. **Analyzing product performance** (01:11 - 01:56)
2. **Client call with Acme Corp** (06:34 - 07:19)
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (14:51 - 15:51)

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
