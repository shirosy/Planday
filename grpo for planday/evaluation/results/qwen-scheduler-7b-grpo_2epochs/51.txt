To create an optimized schedule that respects all given constraints and prioritizes the "AI keynote," let's analyze the events and their timings:

1. **Async Python talk**: 08:21 - 09:21 (Weight = 1)
2. **AI keynote**: 10:47 - 11:47 (Weight = 2)
3. **Web3 panel discussion**: 11:45 - 12:15 (Weight = 1)
4. **Drone building hackathon**: 12:26 - 14:11 (Weight = 1)

### Analysis:
- The "AI keynote" has a higher priority (weight = 2).
- The "Web3 panel discussion" overlaps with the "AI keynote." Since it has a lower priority (weight = 1), we should exclude it to avoid overlap.
- The "Drone building hackathon" starts after the "AI keynote," so it doesn't conflict with the "AI keynote."

### Schedule Optimization:
1. Include the "Async Python talk" from 08:21 - 09:21 (Weight = 1).
2. Include the "AI keynote" from 10:47 - 11:47 (Weight = 2).
3. Exclude the "Web3 panel discussion" due to overlap with the "AI keynote."
4. Include the "Drone building hackathon" from 12:26 - 14:11 (Weight = 1).

By excluding the "Web3 panel discussion," we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
