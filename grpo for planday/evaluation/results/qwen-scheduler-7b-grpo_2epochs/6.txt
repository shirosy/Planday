To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to prioritize the events based on their importance and ensure that no overlaps occur. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all events in chronological order**:
   - Shopping at farmer's market (01:48 - 03:18)
   - Walking with Bella (08:22 - 09:07)
   - Reading 'Dune' (14:47 - 15:17)
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:48 - 16:33)
   - Jogging at the park (16:21 - 16:51)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (17:29 - 19:29)

2. **Identify overlapping events**:
   - The "Deep cleaning the kitchen" event overlaps with the "Jogging at the park" event from 16:21 to 16:33.

3. **Resolve overlaps using priorities**:
   - Since "Reading 'Dune'" has a higher priority (weight = 2) compared to "Deep cleaning the kitchen" (weight = 1), we will keep "Reading 'Dune'" and exclude "Deep cleaning the kitchen".

4. **Revised list after resolving overlaps**:
   - Shopping at farmer's market (01:48 - 03:18)
   - Walking with Bella (08:22 - 09:07)
   - Reading 'Dune' (14:47 - 15:17)
   - Jogging at the park (16:21 - 16:51)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (17:29 - 19:29)

5. **Calculate the sum of weighted event durations**:
   - Weighted duration of "Shopping at farmer's market": 01:48 - 03:18 = 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes
   - Weighted duration of "Walking with Bella": 08:22 - 09:07 = 45 minutes
   - Weighted duration of "Reading 'Dune'": 14:47 - 15:17 = 30 minutes
   - Weighted duration of "Jogging at the park": 16:21 - 16:51 = 30 minutes
   - Weighted duration of "Planting flowers in the garden": 17:29 - 19:29 = 2 hours = 120 minutes

   Total weighted duration: 90 + 45 + 30 + 30 + 120 = 325 minutes

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
