To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that there are no overlaps while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1. **List all events with their start and end times:**
   - One-on-one with manager (02:30 - 04:15)
   - Replying to emails (04:03 - 04:48)
   - Meeting with Lisa at café (12:29 - 14:14)
   - Analyzing product performance (13:41 - 14:41)
   - Preparing PTO handover (18:46 - 20:01)

2. **Identify the priority event:**
   - Analyzing product performance (13:41 - 14:41) [Priority]

3. **Check for conflicts and maximize the sum of weighted event durations:**

   - **One-on-one with manager (02:30 - 04:15):** This event has a weight of 1.
   - **Replying to emails (04:03 - 04:48):** This event has a weight of 1. It overlaps with the one-on-one meeting, so it cannot be included.
   - **Meeting with Lisa at café (12:29 - 14:14):** This event has a weight of 1. It conflicts with the analyzing product performance event, so it cannot be included.
   - **Analyzing product performance (13:41 - 14:41):** This event has a weight of 2. Since it conflicts with the meeting with Lisa, we need to consider other options.
   - **Preparing PTO handover (18:46 - 20:01):** This event has a weight of 1.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the maximum number of events into the schedule:

- Start with the one-on-one meeting (02:30 - 04:15).
- Next, the preparing PTO handover (18:46 - 20:01).

For the remaining slots between 04:15 and 12:29, and 14:14 and 18:46, we can fit the analyzing product performance event (13:41 - 14:41).

So, the optimized schedule would look like this:

</think>
<schedule>
<event>
<name>One-on-one with manager</name>
<start>02:30</start>
<end>04:15</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Analyzing product performance</name>
<start>13:41</start>
<end>14:41</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Preparing PTO handover</name>
<start>18:46</start>
<end>20:01</end>
</event>
</schedule>
