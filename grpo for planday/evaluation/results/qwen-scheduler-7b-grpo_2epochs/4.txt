To create an optimized schedule, we need to ensure that all events are placed in chronological order while respecting the priorities and avoiding any overlaps. The goal is to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all events with their weights:**
   - Structural Dynamics lecture (00:34 - 01:19): Weight = 1
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:20 - 03:20): Weight = 1
   - Chemistry experiment (08:12 - 09:57): Weight = 1
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake (09:54 - 10:09): Weight = 2
   - Chess with Daniel (19:03 - 21:03): Weight = 1
   - Group study for physics test (19:41 - 21:26): Weight = 1

2. **Identify overlapping events:**
   - There are no direct overlaps between events as specified.

3. **Place high-priority events first:**
   - The only high-priority event is "Meeting with Emma and Jake" at 09:54 - 10:09. This should be placed as early as possible without conflicting with other events.

4. **Place other events around the high-priority event:**
   - We need to ensure that no two events overlap, especially considering the priority of the meeting.

5. **Adjust the schedule accordingly:**
   - The Chemistry experiment from 08:12 - 09:57 does not conflict with the meeting, so it can remain.
   - The Group study for physics test from 19:41 - 21:26 also does not conflict with the chess game, so it can remain.
   - The Chess game from 19:03 - 21:03 conflicts with the Group study. Since the group study has lower weight, we will exclude it.

Final Schedule:
- Structural Dynamics lecture (00:34 - 01:19)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:20 - 03:20)
- Chemistry experiment (08:12 - 09:57)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (09:54 - 10:09)
- Chess with Daniel (19:03 - 21:03)

This schedule respects the chronological order, prioritizes the meeting, and avoids overlaps while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.
