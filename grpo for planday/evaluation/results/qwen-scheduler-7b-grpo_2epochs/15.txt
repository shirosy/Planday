To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints and prioritizes the "Updating website content" event, we need to carefully analyze the event times and ensure no overlaps while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

Here's the initial list of events with their weights:
1. Analyzing product performance (07:14 - 07:59) [Weight = 1]
2. Marketing standup on Zoom (12:37 - 13:07) [Weight = 1]
3. Meeting with Lisa at café (12:56 - 14:11) [Weight = 1]
4. Q1 revenue report writing (14:25 - 15:25) [Weight = 1]
5. One-on-one with manager (17:20 - 18:50) [Weight = 1]
6. Updating website content (17:42 - 19:27) [Weight = 2]

First, let's try to fit all events into the schedule:

1. **Analyzing product performance** (07:14 - 07:59) [Weight = 1]
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (12:37 - 13:07) [Weight = 1]
3. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (12:56 - 14:11) [Weight = 1] - Conflicts with Marketing standup, so skip this event.
4. **Q1 revenue report writing** (14:25 - 15:25) [Weight = 1]
5. **One-on-one with manager** (17:20 - 18:50) [Weight = 1]
6. **Updating website content** (17:42 - 19:27) [Weight = 2] - Conflicts with One-on-one with manager, so skip this event.

Since updating website content has the highest weight and cannot overlap with any other event, we need to exclude one event from the schedule to make room for it. Given the priorities and the fact that some events have lower weights, excluding "Meeting with Lisa at café" seems reasonable as it does not carry as much weight as the others.

Let's re-evaluate the schedule after excluding "Meeting with Lisa at café":

1. **Analyzing product performance** (07:14 - 07:59) [Weight = 1]
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (12:37 - 13:07) [Weight = 1]
3. **Q1 revenue report writing** (14:25 - 15:25) [Weight = 1]
4. **One-on-one with manager** (17:20 - 18:50) [Weight = 1]
5. **Updating website content** (17:42 - 19:27) [Weight = 2]

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints and prioritizing the "Updating website content" event.
