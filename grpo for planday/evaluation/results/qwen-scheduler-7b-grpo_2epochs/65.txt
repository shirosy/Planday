To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The only priority event is "Updating website content" with a weight of 2.
2. **Arrange Non-Priority Events**: All other events have a weight of 1.
3. **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure no two events overlap, and prioritize the longer event if there's a conflict.
4. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: Prioritize including the highest-weighted events where possible.

Given the events and priorities, here’s how we can arrange them:

- **Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52)**: This event starts before the priority event begins, so it should be included.
- **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52)**: This event overlaps with the meeting with Lisa and cannot be included because it has a lower weight.
- **Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49)**: This event does not overlap with any priority event and should be included.
- **Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16)**: This is the priority event and should be included.
- **Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58)**: This event overlaps with the updating website content and cannot be included.
- **One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49)**: This event does not overlap with any priority event and should be included.

By following these steps, we ensure that the priority event is included and no overlaps occur. The final schedule will maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
