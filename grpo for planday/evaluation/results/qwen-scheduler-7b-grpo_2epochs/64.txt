To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations, we need to carefully consider the placement of each event. Given that "Calling Mom and Dad" has the highest priority (weight = 2), it should be scheduled as early as possible without conflicting with other events. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (00:16 - 01:01): This event starts early and does not conflict with any high-priority events.
2. **Walking with Bella** (06:50 - 07:50): This event fits well after the morning activities.
3. **Calling Mom and Dad** (14:52 - 16:22): This is our priority event and needs to be scheduled early to maximize its impact.
4. **Cooking pasta** (18:28 - 19:13): This event follows logically after the afternoon activities.
5. **Jogging at the park** (19:05 - 19:20): This event overlaps with "Cooking pasta". Since "Cooking pasta" has a higher priority, "Jogging at the park" will be excluded.
6. **Yoga class with Emily** (20:35 - 22:05): This event fits well after the cooking activity.

Given these considerations, here is the optimized schedule:

- **Deep cleaning the kitchen**: 00:16 - 01:01 (weight = 1)
- **Walking with Bella**: 06:50 - 07:50 (weight = 1)
- **Calling Mom and Dad**: 14:52 - 16:22 (weight = 2)
- **Cooking pasta**: 18:28 - 19:13 (weight = 1)
- **Yoga class with Emily**: 20:35 - 22:05 (weight = 1)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
