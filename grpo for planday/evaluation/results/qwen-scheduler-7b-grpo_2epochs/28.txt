To create an optimized schedule that respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations, I need to carefully consider the placement of each event, especially prioritizing the 3D printing workshop which has a weight of 2.

1. **AI keynote (00:12 - 01:57)**: This event should not be moved as it starts at 00:12.
2. **Digital detox meditation session (01:01 - 02:01)**: Conflicts with the AI keynote. Since the AI keynote has a higher weight, we will keep it and exclude the meditation session.
3. **Live coding on Rust (02:58 - 03:58)**: This event starts after the AI keynote and does not conflict with any other events.
4. **Trying new VR headset (05:51 - 07:36)**: This event does not conflict with any other events.
5. **3D printing workshop (07:57 - 09:57)**: This event has a high priority and should be included. It starts right after the VR headset session and ends before the web3 panel discussion.
6. **Web3 panel discussion (19:20 - 20:05)**: This event does not conflict with any other events.
7. **Drone building hackathon (19:46 - 21:16)**: Conflicts with the web3 panel discussion. Since the web3 panel discussion has a higher weight, we will keep it and exclude the drone building hackathon.
8. **Small Language Models talk (21:50 - 22:05)**: This event does not conflict with any other events.

By following these steps, we ensure that the 3D printing workshop is included, and no overlaps occur. We also maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the chronological order and event weights.
