To optimize the schedule while respecting all the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The "Shopping at farmer's market" event has the highest priority (weight = 2).

2. **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure that no other events overlap with the priority event. If there are any overlaps, remove the lower-priority event.

3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: Prioritize events with higher weights when conflicts arise.

4. **Respect Chronological Order**: Maintain the absolute start and end times of each event.

Let's analyze the events:

- **Planting flowers in the garden (03:11 - 03:26)**: This does not conflict with the priority event.
- **Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)**: Conflicts with the cooking pasta event (04:34 - 05:04). Since jogging has a higher weight, we keep it.
- **Cooking pasta (04:34 - 05:04)**: Overlaps with jogging, so it gets removed.
- **Walking with Bella (14:14 - 14:59)**: Does not conflict with the priority event.
- **Yoga class with Emily (17:58 - 18:43)**: Does not conflict with the priority event.
- **Shopping at farmer's market (21:05 - 21:35)**: Has the highest priority and does not conflict with any other event.

Given these considerations, here is the optimized schedule:
