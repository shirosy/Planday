To create an optimized schedule that respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations, we need to carefully consider the start and end times of each event and prioritize the high-weight events.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List Events**: Start by listing all events along with their start and end times.
   - Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04)
   - AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48)
   - Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01)
   - Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)
   - Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)
   - Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)
   - Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57)
   - Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)

2. **Identify Priorities**: Identify the high-priority events.
   - Small Language Models talk (Weight = 2)
   - Live coding on Rust (Weight = 2)

3. **Check for Conflicts**:
   - **Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04)**: No conflict.
   - **AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48)**: Conflicts with Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01).
   - **Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01)**: Conflict with AI keynote.
   - **Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)**: No conflict.
   - **Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)**: No conflict.
   - **Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)**: No conflict.
   - **Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57)**: No conflict.
   - **Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)**: Conflicts with Live coding on Rust (21:40 - 22:55).

4. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - Since both high-priority events have overlapping time slots with other events, we need to choose which one to keep. We will prioritize keeping the event with the highest weight.
     - **Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)** has a weight of 2.
     - **Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57)** has a weight of 2.
     - Both have the same weight, so we will keep both since they don't overlap directly with each other.

5. **Final Schedule**:
   - **Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04)**
   - **AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48)**
   - **Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)**
   - **Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)**
   - **Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)**
   - **Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57)**
   - **Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)**

This schedule ensures that all high-priority events are included, no overlaps occur, and the sum of weighted event durations is maximized.
