To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, I need to prioritize the "Q1 revenue report writing" event and ensure it does not overlap with any other events. Additionally, I need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without causing any conflicts.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Conflicts**: Check for any potential conflicts between the "Q1 revenue report writing" event and other events.
2. **Adjust Schedule**: If there are conflicts, remove the less important event (normal event with weight = 1).
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: Ensure that the "Q1 revenue report writing" event is included and no other event overlaps with it.

Let's go through the events:

- **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:37 - 02:07): This is a priority event.
- **Marketing standup on Zoom** (00:38 - 02:23): Overlaps with "Q1 revenue report writing". Remove the marketing standup since it has lower priority.
- **One-on-one with manager** (09:43 - 10:58): Does not conflict with "Q1 revenue report writing".
- **Replying to emails** (10:42 - 12:12): Overlaps with "One-on-one with manager". Remove "Replying to emails" since it has lower priority.
- **Meeting with Lisa at café** (17:07 - 17:22): Does not conflict with "Q1 revenue report writing".

After removing the conflicting events, the optimized schedule is:

1. **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:37 - 02:07)
2. **One-on-one with manager** (09:43 - 10:58)
3. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (17:07 - 17:22)

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
