To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given rules.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Trying new VR headset (00:18 - 00:48)**: Weight = 2
   - This event should be scheduled as early as possible due to its high priority.

2. **Small Language Models talk (03:08 - 04:38)**: Weight = 1
   - This event can fit after the VR headset session without conflict.

3. **Digital detox meditation session (08:12 - 09:12)**: Weight = 2
   - This event has high priority and should be scheduled as soon as possible after any conflicting event.

4. **AI keynote (10:57 - 12:42)**: Weight = 1
   - This event can fit after the digital detox session.

5. **Live coding on Rust (11:19 - 12:49)**: Weight = 1
   - This event overlaps with the AI keynote. Since the AI keynote has a lower weight, it will be excluded.

6. **Networking with engineers (12:47 - 14:47)**: Weight = 1
   - This event cannot fit after the live coding session because it overlaps. It will be excluded.

7. **Web3 panel discussion (18:26 - 19:41)**: Weight = 1
   - This event can fit after any other event without conflict.

8. **Async Python talk (21:06 - 23:06)**: Weight = 1
   - This event can fit at the end of the day without conflict.

### Final Schedule:

- **Trying new VR headset**: 00:18 - 00:48 (Weight = 2)
- **Small Language Models talk**: 03:08 - 04:38 (Weight = 1)
- **Digital detox meditation session**: 08:12 - 09:12 (Weight = 2)
- **AI keynote**: 10:57 - 12:42 (Weight = 1)
- **Web3 panel discussion**: 18:26 - 19:41 (Weight = 1)
- **Async Python talk**: 21:06 - 23:06 (Weight = 1)

This schedule respects the chronological order, prioritizes high-weight events, and excludes overlapping events to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
