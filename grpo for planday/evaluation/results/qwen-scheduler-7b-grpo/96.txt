To optimize the schedule while respecting all rules, I need to prioritize the "3D printing workshop" and ensure it doesn't conflict with any other events. Let's analyze the timeline:

1. **3D printing workshop**: 04:39 - 05:09
2. **Drone building hackathon**: 05:50 - 07:20
3. **Live coding on Rust**: 20:36 - 21:21
4. **Digital detox meditation session**: 20:52 - 21:37

The "3D printing workshop" starts at 04:39 and ends at 05:09. This leaves a gap between 05:09 and 05:50 where we can fit another event. However, the "Drone building hackathon" starts at 05:50, so there's no room to insert another event without overlapping.

Next, let's look at the evening events. Both "Live coding on Rust" and "Digital detox meditation session" have overlapping times (20:36 - 21:37). According to the rules, we should choose the event with the higher weighted time. Since both events have the same weight (1), we can exclude one of them. We'll exclude the "Digital detox meditation session" as it ends later and might be less critical.

So, our optimized schedule will be:

1. 3D printing workshop (04:39 - 05:09)
2. Drone building hackathon (05:50 - 07:20)
3. Live coding on Rust (20:36 - 21:21)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while adhering to all rules.
