To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, I need to carefully consider the placement of each event, especially prioritizing the "Small Language Models talk" which has a weight of 2.

1. **Small Language Models talk (07:45 - 09:15)**: This is our highest-priority event. It should not be moved or shortened.
2. **Web3 panel discussion (11:42 - 12:27)**: This event starts after the first one ends, so it fits chronologically without conflict.
3. **3D printing workshop (12:17 - 13:17)**: This event overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion. Since the Web3 panel discussion has a lower weight (1), we will exclude it from the schedule to avoid overlap and maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
4. **Live coding on Rust (13:38 - 15:38)**: This event follows the non-overlapping event and does not conflict with any other scheduled events.

By following these steps, we ensure that the "Small Language Models talk" is included, and no conflicts arise due to overlapping events. The total weighted duration is maximized as per the rules.
