To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them according to their weights.

1. **Digital detox meditation session**: Start at 02:53 - End at 04:08 (Weight = 1)
2. **Drone building hackathon**: Start at 03:52 - End at 05:52 (Weight = 1)
3. **AI keynote**: Start at 11:20 - End at 12:05 (Weight = 2)
4. **Networking with engineers**: Start at 13:31 - End at 14:46 (Weight = 1)

Given that the AI keynote has the highest priority (weight = 2), it should be included in the schedule regardless of conflicts. Let's see how we can fit the other events around it.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **AI keynote**:
   - Start: 11:20
   - End: 12:05

2. **Networking with engineers**:
   - Start: 13:31
   - End: 14:46
   - This event does not conflict with the AI keynote and respects the chronological order.

Since the AI keynote is prioritized and non-overlapping, we can include both the AI keynote and the networking event without any issues.

Now, let's consider the other two events:

3. **Digital detox meditation session**:
   - Start: 02:53
   - End: 04:08
   - This event overlaps with the drone building hackathon from 03:52 to 04:08. Since the drone building hackathon has a lower weight (1), we will exclude it to maximize the weighted duration.

4. **Drone building hackathon**:
   - As mentioned, we exclude this event due to overlap with the digital detox meditation session.

### Final Schedule:

- **Digital detox meditation session**: Excluded
- **Drone building hackathon**: Excluded
- **AI keynote**: Start at 11:20 - End at 12:05 (Weight = 2)
- **Networking with engineers**: Start at 13:31 - End at 14:46 (Weight = 1)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
