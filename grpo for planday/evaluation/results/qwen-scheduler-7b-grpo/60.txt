To create an optimized schedule while respecting all constraints, let's first analyze the events and their priorities:

1. **Networking with engineers (05:03 - 06:18)**: This event has a weight of 1.
2. **Small Language Models talk (05:24 - 06:39)**: This event has a weight of 2, making it a priority.
3. **Trying new VR headset (10:03 - 10:48)**: This event has a weight of 1.
4. **AI keynote (12:39 - 14:09)**: This event has a weight of 1.

Given that the "Small Language Models talk" is a priority event, we need to ensure it does not conflict with any other events. Let's evaluate the schedule step-by-step:

- **05:03 - 06:18**: Networking with engineers (weight = 1)
- **05:24 - 06:39**: Small Language Models talk (weight = 2) - This cannot overlap with the networking event, so it starts at 05:24.

Since the "Small Language Models talk" event starts at 05:24, it will naturally end at 06:39 without conflicting with the networking event.

Now, let's look at the remaining events:

- **10:03 - 10:48**: Trying new VR headset (weight = 1)
- **12:39 - 14:09**: AI keynote (weight = 1)

These events do not conflict with each other and also do not conflict with the "Small Language Models talk" event, which ends at 06:39. Therefore, they can both fit into the schedule without any issues.

Thus, the optimized schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
