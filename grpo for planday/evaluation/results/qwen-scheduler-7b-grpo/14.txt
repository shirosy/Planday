To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, let's analyze the events step-by-step:

1. **Shopping at farmer's market (01:40 - 03:40)**: This is a priority event.
2. **Cooking pasta (03:23 - 04:08)**: This event overlaps with the shopping event. Since the cooking event has a lower priority (weight = 1) compared to the shopping event (weight = 2), we will exclude it.
3. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:46 - 08:46)**: This is a normal event.
4. **Walking with Bella (08:28 - 09:28)**: This event overlaps with the deep cleaning event. Since walking with Bella has a lower priority (weight = 1) compared to the deep cleaning event (weight = 1), we will exclude it.
5. **Reading 'Dune' (09:59 - 10:29)**: This is a normal event.
6. **Planting flowers in the garden (14:09 - 15:54)**: This is a priority event.
7. **Calling Mom and Dad (18:03 - 20:03)**: This is a priority event.

Now, let's construct the schedule while ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations:

- **01:40 - 03:40**: Shopping at farmer's market (Priority)
- **06:46 - 08:46**: Deep cleaning the kitchen (Normal)
- **09:59 - 10:29**: Reading 'Dune' (Normal)
- **14:09 - 15:54**: Planting flowers in the garden (Priority)
- **18:03 - 20:03**: Calling Mom and Dad (Priority)

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
