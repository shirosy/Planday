To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. **List all events with their start and end times.**
2. **Identify the priority events and assign weights.**
3. **Sort the events chronologically.**
4. **Iterate through the sorted list and prioritize placing high-weight events first.**
5. **Resolve any conflicts by choosing the event with the higher weight.**
6. **Exclude any events that cannot fit without violating the no-overlap rule.**

### Step-by-Step Process

**Sorted Events:**
1. Researching in library (09:35 - 11:05)
2. Group study for physics test (10:41 - 10:56)
3. Office hours with Prof. Chen (12:39 - 13:24)
4. Study session with Sarah and Mike (12:55 - 13:40)
5. Structural Dynamics lecture (15:58 - 16:43)
6. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (18:06 - 19:51)

**Priority Events:**
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (Weight = 2)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (Weight = 2)

**Placement Strategy:**
1. Place "Office hours with Prof. Chen" at 12:39 - 13:24 (highest priority).
2. Check for conflicts with other events.
3. Place "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams" at 18:06 - 19:51 (second highest priority).

### Conflict Resolution

- At 12:39 - 13:24, "Office hours with Prof. Chen" is placed.
- Between 12:55 - 13:40 and 13:24 - 15:58, there is a conflict. Since both events have the same weight (1), we exclude one. We choose to exclude the shorter event "Group study for physics test" (10:41 - 10:56) to avoid overlap.
- At 15:58 - 16:43, "Structural Dynamics lecture" is placed.
- At 18:06 - 19:51, "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams" is placed.

### Final Schedule

By following this approach, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while ensuring no overlaps and respecting the chronological order.
