To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the "Drone building hackathon" and ensure it does not overlap with any other events. I will then arrange the remaining events around it while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

1. **Drone building hackathon** (02:50 - 03:20): This event has a priority weight of 2.
2. **Small Language Models talk** (00:53 - 02:38): This event starts before the hackathon but ends after its start. It should be excluded as it overlaps with the hackathon.
3. **3D printing workshop** (02:52 - 04:37): This event overlaps with the hackathon and should be excluded.
4. **Networking with engineers** (06:16 - 06:31): This event starts after the hackathon and ends early, so it fits well.
5. **Trying new VR headset** (06:17 - 06:47): This event overlaps with networking and should be excluded.
6. **Live coding on Rust** (08:35 - 09:05): This event fits well after networking.
7. **Async Python talk** (09:41 - 11:41): This event fits well after live coding.

By following these steps, we can create a schedule that respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
