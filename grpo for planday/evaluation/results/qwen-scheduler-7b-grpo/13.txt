First, let's identify the key constraints and priorities:

1. **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen** (00:02 - 00:47) has a priority of 2.
2. **Yoga Class with Emily** (18:30 - 20:00) also has a priority of 2.
3. **Jogging at the Park** (02:00 - 03:30) and **Walking with Bella** (02:00 - 02:30) have a priority of 1 each.
4. **Shopping at Farmer's Market** (04:39 - 06:24) has a priority of 1.

Given that both high-priority events need to be included, we need to ensure there are no conflicts between them. Let's evaluate the potential scheduling:

- **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen**: This event starts at 00:02 and ends at 00:47. It does not conflict with any other events.
- **Jogging at the Park**: This event starts at 02:00 and ends at 03:30. It conflicts with the **Walking with Bella** event which also starts at 02:00 and ends at 02:30. Since **Jogging at the Park** has a higher priority, we will keep it and exclude **Walking with Bella**.
- **Shopping at Farmer's Market**: This event starts at 04:39 and ends at 06:24. It does not conflict with any other events.
- **Yoga Class with Emily**: This event starts at 18:30 and ends at 20:00. It does not conflict with any other events.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. Deep Cleaning the Kitchen (00:02 - 00:47)
2. Jogging at the Park (02:00 - 03:30)
3. Shopping at Farmer's Market (04:39 - 06:24)
4. Yoga Class with Emily (18:30 - 20:00)

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
