To create an optimized schedule while respecting all the given rules, I need to prioritize the "Deep cleaning the kitchen" event because it has the highest weight. Let's analyze the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:15 - 03:30)**: This is a priority event and should not be moved or excluded.

2. **Watching 'Inception' (02:51 - 04:21)**: This event overlaps with the "Deep cleaning the kitchen". Since the "Deep cleaning the kitchen" has higher priority, we exclude "Watching 'Inception'".

3. **Yoga class with Emily (04:20 - 06:20)**: This event starts right after the "Deep cleaning the kitchen", so it can be included as it does not overlap.

4. **Calling Mom and Dad (06:45 - 07:30)**: This event follows immediately after the yoga class, so it can also be included without overlapping.

5. **Walking with Bella (20:07 - 21:37)**: This event is scheduled late at night and does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

Given these considerations, the optimized schedule will look like this:
