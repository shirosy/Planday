To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I need to consider the following:

1. **Event Chronology**: Events must be scheduled in strict chronological order based on their start times.
2. **Priority Handling**: Priority events (weight = 2) should be placed before non-priority events (weight = 1) if there is a conflict.
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: We aim to maximize the total duration of all included events.
4. **No Overlaps**: Conflicting events must not overlap, and the event with the higher weight should be included.

Let's analyze the events and priorities:

- **Yoga class with Emily (03:51 - 05:21)**: Weight = 1
- **Cooking pasta (04:01 - 05:16)**: Weight = 1
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen (09:02 - 10:02)**: Weight = 1
- **Watching 'Inception' (16:54 - 18:39)**: Weight = 2

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

1. **Yoga Class (03:51 - 05:21)**:
   - This is a normal event with a weight of 1.

2. **Cooking Pasta (04:01 - 05:16)**:
   - This event starts at 04:01 and ends at 05:16, which overlaps with the yoga class from 04:01 to 05:21.
   - Since both events have the same weight (1), we keep the longer event, which is the yoga class (03:51 - 05:21).

3. **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen (09:02 - 10:02)**:
   - This is a normal event with a weight of 1.

4. **Watching 'Inception' (16:54 - 18:39)**:
   - This event has a weight of 2 and does not overlap with any other events.

Given these considerations, the optimal schedule is as follows:

- **Yoga class with Emily (03:51 - 05:21)**: Weight = 1
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen (09:02 - 10:02)**: Weight = 1
- **Watching 'Inception' (16:54 - 18:39)**: Weight = 2

This schedule respects the chronological order, handles priority events correctly, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
