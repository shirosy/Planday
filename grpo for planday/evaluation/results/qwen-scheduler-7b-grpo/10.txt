To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure no overlaps. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Jam session (02:01 - 03:46)**: Weight = 1
2. **Sum 41 concert (04:38 - 06:23)**: Weight = 1
3. **Backstage tour VIP pass (13:15 - 14:15)**: Weight = 2
4. **David Guetta DJ set (17:23 - 18:23)**: Weight = 1
5. **Silent disco party (17:59 - 18:59)**: Weight = 2

The priorities are:
1. Silent disco party
2. Backstage tour VIP pass

Given these priorities, we should include the Silent disco party and the Backstage tour VIP pass in the schedule. We need to ensure that these two events do not overlap with any other events.

Let's try to fit the events into the schedule while respecting the constraints:

- **Jam session (02:01 - 03:46)**: This event has a low weight and does not conflict with any high-priority events, so it can stay.
- **Sum 41 concert (04:38 - 06:23)**: This event also has a low weight and does not conflict with any high-priority events, so it can stay.
- **Backstage tour VIP pass (13:15 - 14:15)**: This event has a high priority and does not conflict with any other events, so it can stay.
- **David Guetta DJ set (17:23 - 18:23)**: This event has a low weight and conflicts with the Silent disco party (17:59 - 18:59). Since the Silent disco party has higher priority, we will exclude the David Guetta DJ set.
- **Silent disco party (17:59 - 18:59)**: This event has a high priority and does not conflict with any other events, so it can stay.

Now, let's calculate the sum of weighted event durations:

- Jam session: 1 hour * 1 = 1
- Sum 41 concert: 1 hour * 1 = 1
- Backstage tour VIP pass: 1 hour * 2 = 2
- Silent disco party: 1 hour * 2 = 2

Total weighted duration: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 hours

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
