To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given rules.

1. **Web3 panel discussion** (10:27 - 12:12) has a weight of 2.
2. **Live coding on Rust** (11:28 - 12:58) also has a weight of 2.
3. **Trying new VR headset** (09:16 - 10:16) has a weight of 1.
4. **Drone building hackathon** (20:32 - 22:02) has a weight of 1.
5. **AI keynote** (21:19 - 22:19) has a weight of 1.

Given that both the Web3 panel discussion and the live coding on Rust have the highest priority and overlap, we need to choose one of them. Since the goal is to maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should select the event that spans the longest duration within its available slot.

- **Web3 panel discussion** (10:27 - 12:12) is 1 hour and 45 minutes long.
- **Live coding on Rust** (11:28 - 12:58) is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.

The Web3 panel discussion is longer and thus carries more weight. Therefore, we will include it in the schedule.

Next, let's consider the other events:

- **Trying new VR headset** (09:16 - 10:16): This event fits before the Web3 panel discussion and does not conflict with any prioritized events.
- **Drone building hackathon** (20:32 - 22:02): This event fits after the Web3 panel discussion and does not conflict with any prioritized events.
- **AI keynote** (21:19 - 22:19): This event fits between the Drone building hackathon and the next day, and does not conflict with any prioritized events.

By including all non-conflicting events, we ensure that the schedule is optimized for maximum weighted event duration without any overlaps.

Final Schedule:
1. Trying new VR headset (09:16 - 10:16)
2. Web3 panel discussion (10:27 - 12:12)
3. Drone building hackathon (20:32 - 22:02)
4. AI keynote (21:19 - 22:19)
