To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to carefully consider the priority events and ensure that no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate the events and prioritize them:

1. **Live coding on Rust** (00:59 - 02:59) - Weight = 1
2. **Small Language Models talk** (07:32 - 08:32) - Weight = 1
3. **Web3 panel discussion** (08:16 - 09:46) - Weight = 1
4. **Trying new VR headset** (08:56 - 09:41) - Priority, Weight = 2
5. **AI keynote** (10:36 - 12:06) - Weight = 1
6. **Async Python talk** (14:00 - 14:15) - Weight = 1
7. **3D printing workshop** (16:43 - 18:43) - Priority, Weight = 2

First, let's place the priority events:
- **3D printing workshop** (16:43 - 18:43) - This event has high priority and should be scheduled first among other priorities.
- **Trying new VR headset** (08:56 - 09:41) - This event also has high priority and needs to be placed as soon as possible without overlapping with other events.

Now, let's try to fit the remaining events into the schedule:

- **Live coding on Rust** (00:59 - 02:59) - Fits before any conflicting events.
- **Small Language Models talk** (07:32 - 08:32) - Fits after Live coding on Rust.
- **Web3 panel discussion** (08:16 - 09:46) - Conflicts with Trying new VR headset. Since Trying new VR headset has higher priority, it takes precedence.
- **AI keynote** (10:36 - 12:06) - Fits after Web3 panel discussion.
- **Async Python talk** (14:00 - 14:15) - Fits after AI keynote.

Let's finalize the schedule:

1. **Live coding on Rust** (00:59 - 02:59)
2. **Small Language Models talk** (07:32 - 08:32)
3. **Trying new VR headset** (08:56 - 09:41)
4. **Web3 panel discussion** (08:16 - 09:46) - Overlaps with Trying new VR headset, so remove Web3 panel discussion.
5. **AI keynote** (10:36 - 12:06)
6. **Async Python talk** (14:00 - 14:15)
7. **3D printing workshop** (16:43 - 18:43)

By removing the Web3 panel discussion, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while adhering to all constraints.
