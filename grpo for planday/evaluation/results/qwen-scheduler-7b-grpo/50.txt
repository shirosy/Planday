To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, let's analyze the events and priorities step-by-step:

1. **Silent disco party** (14:40 - 16:10) has a high priority.
2. **Fireworks** (08:34 - 09:34) also has a high priority.
3. **David Guetta DJ set** (17:32 - 18:17) is a normal event.
4. **Sum 41 concert** (18:10 - 18:25) is a normal event.
5. **Korean BBQ food trucks** (21:41 - 22:26) is a normal event.

Given that the silent disco party starts at 14:40 and ends at 16:10, it cannot overlap with any other event. Therefore, we should prioritize including it in the schedule.

Next, the fireworks event from 08:34 to 09:34 can be included since it does not conflict with the silent disco party and has a high priority.

The David Guetta DJ set from 17:32 to 18:17 overlaps with the Sum 41 concert from 18:10 to 18:25. Since the Sum 41 concert has a lower priority, it should be excluded to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Finally, the Korean BBQ food trucks from 21:41 to 22:26 do not conflict with any other events and can be included.

Thus, the optimized schedule will include:
- Fireworks (08:34 - 09:34)
- Silent disco party (14:40 - 16:10)
- Korean BBQ food trucks (21:41 - 22:26)
