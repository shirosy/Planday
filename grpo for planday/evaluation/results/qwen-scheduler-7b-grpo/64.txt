To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the "Calling Mom and Dad" event and ensure it is placed at its scheduled time without causing any conflicts. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (00:16 - 01:01): This event starts early and ends before the priority event begins.
2. **Walking with Bella** (06:50 - 07:50): This event fits well after the morning activities.
3. **Calling Mom and Dad** (14:52 - 16:22): This is our priority event.
4. **Cooking pasta** (18:28 - 19:13): This event follows the priority event.
5. **Jogging at the park** (19:05 - 19:20): There's a conflict here as it overlaps with cooking pasta. We need to exclude one of these events.
6. **Yoga class with Emily** (20:35 - 22:05): This event should be included after the remaining events.

Given the constraints, we need to choose between jogging at the park and cooking pasta. Since cooking pasta has a higher priority due to its duration, we will exclude jogging at the park.

Final Schedule:
1. Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:16 - 01:01)
2. Walking with Bella (06:50 - 07:50)
3. Calling Mom and Dad (14:52 - 16:22)
4. Cooking pasta (18:28 - 19:13)
5. Yoga class with Emily (20:35 - 22:05)
