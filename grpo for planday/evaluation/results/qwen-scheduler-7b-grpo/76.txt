To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their absolute start and end times.
2. Place the priority events in their exact positions as specified.
3. Insert the remaining events in chronological order, ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.
4. If necessary, exclude events that would cause overlaps or reduce the total weighted duration.

Given events:
- Drone building hackathon (00:08 - 00:53)
- AI keynote (00:53 - 02:08)
- Async Python talk (03:50 - 04:35)
- Web3 panel discussion (06:57 - 08:12)
- Trying new VR headset (08:24 - 10:24)
- Live coding on Rust (17:21 - 18:36)
- Small Language Models talk (19:59 - 20:59)

Priority events:
- Web3 panel discussion

Let's start placing the events:

1. **Drone building hackathon** (00:08 - 00:53): This event is not a priority, so it will be placed first.
2. **AI keynote** (00:53 - 02:08): This event follows the drone building hackathon without overlap.
3. **Async Python talk** (03:50 - 04:35): This event starts at 03:50 and ends at 04:35, which does not conflict with any other events.
4. **Web3 panel discussion** (06:57 - 08:12): This is a priority event and should be placed exactly as specified.
5. **Trying new VR headset** (08:24 - 10:24): This event conflicts with the Web3 panel discussion because they both start at 08:24. Since the Web3 panel discussion has higher priority, we will exclude this event.
6. **Live coding on Rust** (17:21 - 18:36): This event starts at 17:21 and ends at 18:36, which does not conflict with any other events.
7. **Small Language Models talk** (19:59 - 20:59): This event starts at 19:59 and ends at 20:59, which does not conflict with any other events.
