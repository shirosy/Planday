To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to prioritize the AI keynote and ensure it does not overlap with any other events. Let's analyze the events and their priorities:

1. **Web3 panel discussion** (01:15 - 02:00): Weight = 1
2. **Trying new VR headset** (01:40 - 02:10): Weight = 1
3. **Async Python talk** (05:30 - 06:45): Weight = 1
4. **AI keynote** (06:18 - 07:03): Weight = 2
5. **Networking with engineers** (20:35 - 21:50): Weight = 1

The AI keynote has a higher priority and should be included if possible without overlapping with other events. Let's see if we can fit it into the schedule:

- The Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00) starts at 01:15 and ends at 02:00.
- The Trying new VR headset (01:40 - 02:10) overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion, so it cannot be included.
- The Async Python talk (05:30 - 06:45) starts after the Web3 panel discussion and before the AI keynote.
- The AI keynote (06:18 - 07:03) starts at 06:18 and ends at 07:03, which conflicts with the Async Python talk that runs from 05:30 to 06:45. Therefore, the Async Python talk cannot be included either.
- The Networking with engineers (20:35 - 21:50) starts after the AI keynote and does not conflict with any other events.

Given these constraints, the optimized schedule will include the AI keynote and exclude the conflicting events. The Web3 panel discussion will remain as it is, and the Networking with engineers will also be included.

Final Schedule:
- Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00)
- AI keynote (06:18 - 07:03)
- Networking with engineers (20:35 - 21:50)
