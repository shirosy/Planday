To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to ensure that the highest-priority event ("Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick") is included first. We should then fit other events around it without any overlaps, prioritizing those with higher weights when necessary.

Let's break down the events:

1. **Preparing PTO handover (00:27 - 01:27)** - Weight = 1
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom (04:14 - 05:29)** - Weight = 1
3. **Client call with Acme Corp (08:18 - 08:48)** - Weight = 1
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (11:20 - 12:05)** - Weight = 2 (highest priority)
5. **Q1 revenue report writing (11:38 - 12:38)** - Weight = 1
6. **Analyzing product performance (16:27 - 16:57)** - Weight = 1
7. **One-on-one with manager (16:39 - 17:39)** - Weight = 1

Given the high priority of "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick," we should try to avoid scheduling other events during its time slot. However, since there is a conflict between "Q1 revenue report writing" and "Analyzing product performance" both starting at 11:38, we need to exclude one of them. 

Let's choose to exclude "Q1 revenue report writing" because it has a lower weight (1) compared to "Analyzing product performance" (1). This way, we can fit both "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" and "Analyzing product performance" into the schedule.

Now let's construct the schedule:

1. **Preparing PTO handover (00:27 - 01:27)** - Weight = 1
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom (04:14 - 05:29)** - Weight = 1
3. **Client call with Acme Corp (08:18 - 08:48)** - Weight = 1
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (11:20 - 12:05)** - Weight = 2 (highest priority)
5. **Analyzing product performance (16:27 - 16:57)** - Weight = 1
6. **One-on-one with manager (16:39 - 17:39)** - Weight = 1

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
