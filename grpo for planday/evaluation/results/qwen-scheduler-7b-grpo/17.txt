To create an optimized schedule, I need to consider the absolute start and end times of each event and prioritize the client call with Acme Corp. Since it has a higher weight, it should not be moved. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **One-on-one with manager**: This event starts at 16:30 and ends at 16:45. It does not conflict with any other events.
2. **Meeting with Lisa at café**: This event starts at 19:27 and ends at 19:42. It does not conflict with any other events.
3. **Client call with Acme Corp**: This event starts at 20:22 and ends at 20:37. However, there is a conflict with the "Preparing PTO handover" event which also starts at 20:32 and ends at 20:47. Since the client call has a higher priority, we will keep it and exclude the PTO handover.

By following these steps, we ensure that the highest-priority event is included, and no overlaps occur.
