First, let's identify the key points and constraints:
1. Events must be scheduled in chronological order.
2. Priority events have a higher weight and should be included if possible without causing conflicts.
3. No overlapping events are allowed.
4. We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Let's analyze the events:

- Chess with Daniel (05:34 - 06:49)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (05:45 - 06:30)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (08:03 - 09:48)
- Researching in library (08:28 - 09:13)
- Group study for physics test (10:38 - 11:53)
- Chemistry experiment (15:28 - 17:13)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (16:41 - 17:41)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (19:36 - 19:51)

Priorities:
- Chemistry experiment
- Study session with Sarah and Mike
- Meeting with Emma and Jake

Now, let's try to fit these into the schedule while respecting all constraints:

1. **Chess with Daniel (05:34 - 06:49)**: This event starts at 05:34 and ends at 06:49. It has a normal weight of 1.
2. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (05:45 - 06:30)**: This event starts at 05:45 and ends at 06:30. It has a normal weight of 1. Since it overlaps with Chess, we exclude it.
3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (08:03 - 09:48)**: This event starts at 08:03 and ends at 09:48. It has a high priority and thus a weight of 2. However, it overlaps with Researching in library (08:28 - 09:13). Therefore, we exclude Researching in library.
4. **Chemistry experiment (15:28 - 17:13)**: This event starts at 15:28 and ends at 17:13. It has a high priority and thus a weight of 2. It does not overlap with any other events, so we include it.
5. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (16:41 - 17:41)**: This event starts at 16:41 and ends at 17:41. It has a high priority and thus a weight of 2. It overlaps with Chemistry experiment (15:28 - 17:13), so we exclude it.
6. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (19:36 - 19:51)**: This event starts at 19:36 and ends at 19:51. It has a normal weight of 1. It does not overlap with any other events, so we include it.

Final Schedule:
- Chess with Daniel (05:34 - 06:49)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (08:03 - 09:48)
- Chemistry experiment (15:28 - 17:13)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (19:36 - 19:51)

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
