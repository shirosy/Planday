To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure no overlaps while respecting the absolute start and end times. Let's evaluate each event:

1. **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:29 - 02:29): Weight = 1
2. **Replying to emails** (01:37 - 03:22): Weight = 2
3. **Client call with Acme Corp** (03:35 - 04:20): Weight = 1
4. **Preparing PTO handover** (03:57 - 05:27): Weight = 2 (Priority)
5. **One-on-one with manager** (12:01 - 13:46): Weight = 1
6. **Analyzing product performance** (19:01 - 21:01): Weight = 1

Given the priorities and the need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping, hereâ€™s how we can arrange the events:

- **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:29 - 02:29): Weight = 1
- **Replying to emails** (01:37 - 03:22): Weight = 2
- **Preparing PTO handover** (03:57 - 05:27): Weight = 2 (Overlaps with Client call, so it takes precedence)
- **One-on-one with manager** (12:01 - 13:46): Weight = 1
- **Analyzing product performance** (19:01 - 21:01): Weight = 1

The client call with Acme Corp (03:35 - 04:20) is excluded because it overlaps with the preparing PTO handover and has a lower weight.

Final schedule:
- Q1 revenue report writing (00:29 - 02:29): Weight = 1
- Replying to emails (01:37 - 03:22): Weight = 2
- Preparing PTO handover (03:57 - 05:27): Weight = 2
- One-on-one with manager (12:01 - 13:46): Weight = 1
- Analyzing product performance (19:01 - 21:01): Weight = 1
