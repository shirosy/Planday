To create an optimized schedule that respects all constraints and prioritizes the "Quantum computing guest talk," I will analyze the events and their priorities step-by-step.

1. **Identify overlapping events**: 
   - The "Structural Dynamics lecture" starts at 13:59 and ends at 15:29.
   - The "Study session with Sarah and Mike" also starts at 13:59 and ends at 14:39.
   
   These two events overlap from 13:59 to 14:39.

2. **Determine which event to keep**:
   - Both events have a weight of 1.
   - Since both events have the same weight and there's no clear priority indicated, we need to decide based on other factors like importance or relevance. However, since no further information is provided, we'll keep the one that appears first chronologically to avoid any confusion.
   
   Therefore, we will keep the "Study session with Sarah and Mike" (13:54 - 14:39).

3. **Adjust the schedule**:
   - Remove the "Structural Dynamics lecture" as it overlaps with another event.
   - Ensure all events are in chronological order and respect the absolute start and end times.

4. **Finalize the schedule**:
   - Prioritize the "Quantum computing guest talk" by placing it at its earliest possible time without conflicting with other events.
   - Place the remaining events in chronological order.
