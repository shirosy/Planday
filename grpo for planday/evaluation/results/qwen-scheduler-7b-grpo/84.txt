To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their absolute start and end times.
2. Place the priority events first according to their actual start times.
3. Insert non-priority events only where there's no conflict and they maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
4. If conflicts arise, prioritize the event with the higher weight.

Given events:
- Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)
- Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)
- Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
- Avril Lavigne concert (20:34 - 21:49)
- Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)

Priority events:
- Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
- Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)

Step-by-step placement:

1. **Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)**: This is a priority event and should be placed at its actual start time.
   - Schedule: 
     ```
     Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
     ```

2. **Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)**: This is also a priority event and should be placed at its actual start time.
   - Schedule:
     ```
     Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
     Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)
     ```

3. **Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)**: This event starts before the silent disco party and ends before it, so it can be inserted without conflict.
   - Schedule:
     ```
     Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)
     Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
     Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)
     ```

4. **Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)**: This event can be inserted before the Korean BBQ food trucks as it doesn't conflict with any other events.
   - Schedule:
     ```
     Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)
     Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)
     Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
     Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)
     ```

5. **Avril Lavigne concert (20:34 - 21:49)**: This event cannot be inserted as it would overlap with the Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18). Therefore, it will be excluded from the schedule.

Final schedule:
```
Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)
Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)
Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)
```

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
