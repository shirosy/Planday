To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to carefully consider the start and end times of each event and prioritize the high-weight event (Chess with Daniel).

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all events with their priorities**:
   - Chemistry experiment (03:56 - 04:56, weight = 1)
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen (10:43 - 11:43, weight = 1)
   - Researching in library (12:16 - 14:16, weight = 1)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:54 - 16:09, weight = 1)
   - Chess with Daniel (15:07 - 15:52, weight = 2)
   - Group study for physics test (18:06 - 18:51, weight = 1)

2. **Identify any conflicts**:
   - The Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:54 - 16:09) overlaps with the Chess with Daniel (15:07 - 15:52). Since Chess has higher weight, we will keep it and exclude the Calculus lecture.

3. **Optimize the schedule**:
   - Start with the Chemistry experiment (03:56 - 04:56).
   - Followed by Office hours with Prof. Chen (10:43 - 11:43).
   - Then Researching in library (12:16 - 14:16).
   - Include Chess with Daniel (15:07 - 15:52).
   - Finally, Group study for physics test (18:06 - 18:51).

By following these steps, we ensure that the highest-priority event is included, no overlaps occur, and the schedule is in strict chronological order.
