To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur. Let's analyze the events and their priorities:

1. **Drone building hackathon** (10:02 - 10:47) - Weight = 1
2. **Web3 panel discussion** (16:03 - 16:33) - Weight = 1
3. **Live coding on Rust** (17:22 - 18:52) - Weight = 1
4. **Networking with engineers** (19:56 - 21:56) - Weight = 2
5. **Trying new VR headset** (21:29 - 22:44) - Weight = 2

The priorities are:
- **Trying new VR headset**
- **Networking with engineers**

Given the constraints, we need to place the highest priority events first. However, there are conflicts between "Networking with engineers" and "Trying new VR headset" because they overlap from 21:29 to 21:56.

Since "Networking with engineers" has a higher weight, it should take precedence over "Trying new VR headset". Therefore, "Trying new VR headset" will be excluded to avoid the conflict.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Drone building hackathon** (10:02 - 10:47)
2. **Web3 panel discussion** (16:03 - 16:33)
3. **Live coding on Rust** (17:22 - 18:52)
4. **Networking with engineers** (19:56 - 21:56)

This schedule respects the chronological order, avoids overlaps, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while adhering to the given rules.
