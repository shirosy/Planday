To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, I need to carefully arrange the events according to their start times, weights, and priorities. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **List Events and Prioritize**:
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:40 - 03:40)
   - Chess with Daniel (03:38 - 04:38) [Priority]
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (10:12 - 11:57)
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake (10:18 - 11:18)
   - Structural Dynamics lecture (13:30 - 14:45) [Priority]
   - Researching in library (19:37 - 20:52)

2. **Initial Placement**:
   - Place the Calculus lecture at 01:40 - 03:40 as it has no conflicts.
   - Place the Chess session at 03:38 - 04:38 after the Calculus lecture. This respects the priority and avoids conflict.
   - Place the Structural Dynamics lecture at 13:30 - 14:45. This also respects its priority.

3. **Overlap Handling**:
   - The Study session with Sarah and Mike (10:12 - 11:57) conflicts with both the Meeting with Emma and Jake (10:18 - 11:18). Since the Study session has a lower priority, we exclude it.
   - The Meeting with Emma and Jake (10:18 - 11:18) does not conflict with any other event and is placed after the Study session.
   - The Researching in library (19:37 - 20:52) does not conflict with any other event and is placed last.

4. **Final Schedule Check**:
   - Ensure all events are in chronological order.
   - Verify no overlaps exist.
   - Confirm that the highest-weighted events (Chess and Structural Dynamics) are included.

The resulting schedule respects all rules and optimizes the sum of weighted event durations.
