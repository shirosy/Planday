To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to prioritize the "Quantum computing guest talk" and ensure it does not overlap with any other event. Let's analyze the events and see how they fit together:

1. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:02 - 07:02)** - This is a priority event.
2. **Quantum computing guest talk (11:21 - 12:51)** - This is also a priority event.
3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:44 - 15:14)** - This event does not conflict with the priority events.
4. **Chess with Daniel (18:24 - 19:09)** - This event does not conflict with the priority events.
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:20 - 22:05)** - This event does not conflict with the priority events.
6. **Structural Dynamics lecture (21:35 - 22:20)** - This event overlaps with the calculus lecture, so it cannot be included.

Given these considerations, the optimal schedule would be:

- **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:02 - 07:02)**
- **Quantum computing guest talk (11:21 - 12:51)**
- **Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:44 - 15:14)**
- **Chess with Daniel (18:24 - 19:09)**
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:20 - 22:05)**

This schedule respects the chronological order, includes the priority events, and avoids any overlaps.
