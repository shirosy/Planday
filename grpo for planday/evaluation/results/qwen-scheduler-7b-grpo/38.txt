To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, we need to carefully consider the constraints and priorities. Let's break down the events and prioritize them:

1. **Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07)** - Normal event
2. **Small Language Models talk (07:05 - 08:50)** - Normal event
3. **Async Python talk (16:05 - 16:20)** - Normal event
4. **AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35)** - High-priority event
5. **Networking with engineers (18:01 - 18:16)** - Normal event
6. **Digital detox meditation session (18:53 - 19:23)** - High-priority event
7. **Live coding on Rust (19:45 - 21:00)** - Normal event

Given the high priorities, we need to ensure that the AI keynote and the digital detox meditation session are included without overlap. Let's see how we can fit them into the schedule:

- **Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07)** - Start
- **Small Language Models talk (07:05 - 08:50)** - Overlaps with the drone hackathon, so exclude it.
- **Async Python talk (16:05 - 16:20)** - Start
- **AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35)** - Overlaps with the async Python talk, so exclude it.
- **Networking with engineers (18:01 - 18:16)** - Overlaps with the AI keynote, so exclude it.
- **Digital detox meditation session (18:53 - 19:23)** - Overlaps with the networking event, so exclude it.
- **Live coding on Rust (19:45 - 21:00)** - Start

Since the AI keynote and digital detox meditation session cannot be included due to overlapping normal events, we will exclude them from the schedule. This means we will lose some events to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Final Schedule:
- **Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07)**
- **Async Python talk (16:05 - 16:20)**
- **Live coding on Rust (19:45 - 21:00)**
