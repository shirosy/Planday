To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, we need to carefully consider the constraints and prioritize the events accordingly. The goal is to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while ensuring no overlaps and respecting the absolute start and end times of each event.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The only priority event is "Updating website content" with a weight of 2.
2. **Check for Conflicts**: We need to ensure that the priority event does not overlap with any other event. If it does, we will have to exclude one of the overlapping events.
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: We should try to include as many high-weight events as possible without violating the rules.

Let's analyze the events:

- **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:26 - 00:56): This event starts before the priority event and ends before the priority event begins. It can be included.
- **Updating website content** (00:44 - 01:14): This is our priority event. It overlaps with the revenue report writing event. Since it has a higher weight, we will keep it and exclude the revenue report writing event.
- **One-on-one with manager** (03:32 - 05:32): This event starts after the priority event and can be included.
- **Analyzing product performance** (13:03 - 13:18): This event can be included as it does not overlap with any other events.
- **Replying to emails** (16:53 - 17:53): This event can be included as it does not overlap with any other events.
- **Preparing PTO handover** (19:18 - 21:03): This event can be included as it does not overlap with any other events.

By following these steps, we can create the optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the rules.
