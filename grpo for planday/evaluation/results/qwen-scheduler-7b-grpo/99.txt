To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules and prioritizes the "Trying new VR headset" event, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify overlapping events**: Check if any events overlap based on their start and end times.
2. **Resolve conflicts**: If there are overlapping events, choose the one with the higher weight (priority).
3. **Maximize weighted duration**: Ensure that the total weighted duration is maximized while respecting the chronological order and no-overlap rule.
4. **Exclude non-priority events if necessary**: Remove any non-priority events that cannot fit into the schedule without violating the rules.

Let's analyze the events:

- **Async Python talk (05:46 - 07:46)**: Weight = 1
- **Live coding on Rust (06:39 - 08:09)**: Weight = 1
- **AI keynote (11:39 - 12:24)**: Weight = 1
- **3D printing workshop (15:34 - 17:34)**: Weight = 1
- **Trying new VR headset (16:47 - 17:17)**: Weight = 2

**Overlap Analysis**:
- The "Async Python talk" and "Live coding on Rust" events overlap from 06:39 to 07:46. Since both have the same weight, we need to decide which one to keep.
- The "3D printing workshop" and "Trying new VR headset" events overlap from 16:47 to 17:17. Since the "Trying new VR headset" has a higher weight, it should take precedence over the "3D printing workshop".

Given these considerations, let's resolve the conflicts:

1. **Async Python talk (05:46 - 07:46)**: Keep as it is.
2. **Live coding on Rust (06:39 - 08:09)**: Conflicts with Async Python talk. Since both have the same weight, exclude one. Let's exclude this event.
3. **AI keynote (11:39 - 12:24)**: Keep as it is.
4. **3D printing workshop (15:34 - 17:34)**: Conflicts with Trying new VR headset. Exclude this event.
5. **Trying new VR headset (16:47 - 17:17)**: Keep as it is.

Now, let's construct the final schedule:
