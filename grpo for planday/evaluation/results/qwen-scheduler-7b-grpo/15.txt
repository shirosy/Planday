To optimize the schedule while respecting all rules, I need to carefully consider the constraints and priorities. Let's break down the events:

1. **Analyzing product performance** (07:14 - 07:59): This is a normal event.
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (12:37 - 13:07): This is a normal event.
3. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (12:56 - 14:11): This is a normal event.
4. **Q1 revenue report writing** (14:25 - 15:25): This is a normal event.
5. **One-on-one with manager** (17:20 - 18:50): This is a normal event.
6. **Updating website content** (17:42 - 19:27): This is a priority event.

Given that "Updating website content" has a higher priority (weight = 2), it should not be removed from the schedule. However, we need to ensure there are no conflicts with other events.

Let's analyze the potential conflicts:
- The marketing standup (12:37 - 13:07) overlaps with the meeting with Lisa (12:56 - 14:11). Since both are normal events, we keep the one with the higher priority, which is the meeting with Lisa.
- The updating website content (17:42 - 19:27) overlaps with the one-on-one with the manager (17:20 - 18:50). Since the updating website content is a priority event, we keep it and remove the one-on-one with the manager.

Now, let's construct the optimized schedule:

1. **Analyzing product performance** (07:14 - 07:59)
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (12:37 - 13:07)
3. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (12:56 - 14:11)
4. **Q1 revenue report writing** (14:25 - 15:25)
5. **Updating website content** (17:42 - 19:27)

This schedule respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
