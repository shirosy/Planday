To create an optimized schedule while respecting all the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority event and ensure it's included in its entirety.
2. Schedule other events around the priority event, ensuring no overlaps and that higher-weighted events take precedence over lower-weighted ones.
3. Adjust the schedule as necessary to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without violating any rules.

Given the events:
- Chess with Daniel (02:19 - 03:04)
- Quantum computing guest talk (02:52 - 04:07)
- Researching in library (09:53 - 11:08)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (18:38 - 19:08)

And the priority event:
- Researching in library

Let's analyze the potential conflicts and adjustments:

1. **Chess with Daniel (02:19 - 03:04)** vs **Quantum computing guest talk (02:52 - 04:07)**:
   - These two events overlap from 02:52 to 03:04.
   - Since the quantum computing guest talk has a higher weight (2) compared to chess (1), we will exclude the chess event.

2. **Researching in library (09:53 - 11:08)**:
   - This event does not conflict with any other events and is already scheduled as a priority event.

3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (18:38 - 19:08)**:
   - This event does not conflict with any other events and can be included as is.

So, the optimized schedule will be:

- Researching in library (09:53 - 11:08)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (18:38 - 19:08)

These events do not overlap and respect the priority of the "Researching in library" event.
