The goal is to create an optimized schedule that respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations. We need to prioritize "Watching 'Inception'" while ensuring no overlaps and respecting the absolute start and end times of each event.

Here's the initial list of events with their weights:
- Watching 'Inception': 2 (priority)
- Calling Mom and Dad: 1
- Walking with Bella: 1
- Yoga class with Emily: 1

Given the constraints, we should not move any event unless it's necessary to avoid conflicts or maximize the sum of weighted event durations. Let's analyze the schedule:

1. **Watching 'Inception' (01:29 - 02:44)**: This is a priority event and should be included as is.
2. **Calling Mom and Dad (02:02 - 02:17)**: This event overlaps with "Watching 'Inception'" because it starts before "Watching 'Inception'" ends. Since "Watching 'Inception'" has higher priority, we will exclude "Calling Mom and Dad".
3. **Walking with Bella (10:15 - 12:15)**: This event does not overlap with any other event and can be included.
4. **Yoga class with Emily (13:37 - 15:07)**: This event also does not overlap with any other event and can be included.

By following these steps, we ensure that we respect the priority of "Watching 'Inception'" and do not introduce any overlaps. The final schedule is:
