To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, I need to carefully arrange the events such that the priority event (Yoga class with Emily) is included and no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate the events:

1. **Walking with Bella (00:59 - 02:59)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
2. **Shopping at farmer's market (02:34 - 03:34)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
3. **Calling Mom and Dad (06:59 - 07:44)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
4. **Jogging at the park (07:50 - 09:05)**: Normal event (weight = 1)
5. **Yoga class with Emily (10:11 - 11:11)**: Priority event (weight = 2)
6. **Watching 'Inception' (12:19 - 14:19)**: Normal event (weight = 1)

Given that the Yoga class has the highest priority, it should be placed as soon as possible without overlapping any other events. Let's see how we can fit everything into the schedule:

- **Walking with Bella**: 00:59 - 02:59
- **Shopping at farmer's market**: 02:34 - 03:34 (conflicts with Walking with Bella, so exclude Walking with Bella)
- **Calling Mom and Dad**: 06:59 - 07:44
- **Jogging at the park**: 07:50 - 09:05 (conflicts with Calling Mom and Dad, so exclude Calling Mom and Dad)
- **Yoga class with Emily**: 10:11 - 11:11
- **Watching 'Inception'**: 12:19 - 14:19

Since the Jogging at the park conflicts with the Call to Mom and Dad, we exclude the Jogging session. This allows us to fit all events into the schedule without any overlaps.
