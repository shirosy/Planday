To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations. Let's analyze the given events and priorities:

1. **Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14)** - Weight = 1
2. **Web3 panel discussion (06:08 - 08:08)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
4. **Async Python talk (20:18 - 22:18)** - Weight = 1
5. **Small Language Models talk (20:35 - 22:35)** - Weight = 1

Given the priorities and weights, the Web3 panel discussion and Live coding on Rust should take precedence over other events. However, there is a conflict between the Web3 panel discussion and the Live coding on Rust because they overlap during the period from 06:08 to 08:08. Since both have the same weight (2), we need to decide which one to keep. 

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should keep the event with the highest potential impact or the one that is more relevant to the overall theme. In this case, let's assume both events are equally important, so we will choose the one that ends later to avoid cutting off a significant portion of its duration. Therefore, we will keep the Live coding on Rust.

Now, let's adjust the schedule accordingly:

- **Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14)** - Weight = 1
- **Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
- **Async Python talk (20:18 - 22:18)** - Weight = 1
- **Small Language Models talk (20:35 - 22:35)** - Weight = 1

The Web3 panel discussion conflicts with the Live coding on Rust, so it cannot be included in the schedule as is. If we were to include it, it would cut off the last 17 minutes of the Live coding on Rust, which is not ideal.

Thus, the final schedule will be:
