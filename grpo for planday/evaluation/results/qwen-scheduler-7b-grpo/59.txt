To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur. We will start by listing all events and then apply the rules to determine which events to include in the final schedule.

1. **Reading 'Dune' (01:44 - 03:29)** - Weight = 1
2. **Calling Mom and Dad (11:59 - 13:44)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Shopping at farmer's market (15:33 - 16:48)** - Weight = 1
4. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:57 - 16:42)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
5. **Planting flowers in the garden (18:30 - 20:30)** - Weight = 1
6. **Walking with Bella (21:40 - 23:25)** - Weight = 1

Given the priorities, we should include both "Calling Mom and Dad" and "Deep cleaning the kitchen". Let's see how we can fit these into the schedule without overlapping other events.

- **Reading 'Dune'** from 01:44 to 03:29
- **Calling Mom and Dad** from 11:59 to 13:44
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen** from 15:57 to 16:42 (This conflicts with "Shopping at farmer's market", so we exclude it)
- **Planting flowers in the garden** from 18:30 to 20:30
- **Walking with Bella** from 21:40 to 23:25

Now let's calculate the total weighted duration:

- **Reading 'Dune'**: 01:44 - 03:29 = 1 hour 45 minutes (Weight = 1)
- **Calling Mom and Dad**: 11:59 - 13:44 = 1 hour 45 minutes (Weight = 2)
- **Planting flowers in the garden**: 18:30 - 20:30 = 2 hours (Weight = 1)
- **Walking with Bella**: 21:40 - 23:25 = 1 hour 45 minutes (Weight = 1)

Total weighted duration = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5

The final schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
