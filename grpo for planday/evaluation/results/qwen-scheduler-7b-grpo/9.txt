To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to carefully consider the overlap between high-priority events and other events. Let's analyze the events and prioritize them:

1. **3D printing workshop** (01:17 - 01:47) - Weight = 1
2. **Trying new VR headset** (09:48 - 11:03) - Weight = 2
3. **Drone building hackathon** (11:04 - 11:19) - Weight = 1
4. **Live coding on Rust** (11:14 - 11:44) - Weight = 2
5. **Async Python talk** (19:41 - 20:11) - Weight = 1
6. **AI keynote** (20:26 - 22:26) - Weight = 2
7. **Networking with engineers** (22:12 - 23:42) - Weight = 1

Given that "Trying new VR headset" and "Live coding on Rust" have the highest priority, we should ensure they do not conflict with each other. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **3D printing workshop**: This event starts at 01:17 and ends at 01:47. It does not conflict with any other event.
2. **Trying new VR headset**: This event starts at 09:48 and ends at 11:03. It does not conflict with the 3D printing workshop.
3. **Drone building hackathon**: This event starts at 11:04 and ends at 11:19. It conflicts with the "Trying new VR headset" event. Since "Trying new VR headset" has higher priority, we exclude the "Drone building hackathon".
4. **Live coding on Rust**: This event starts at 11:14 and ends at 11:44. It conflicts with the "Trying new VR headset" event. Since "Trying new VR headset" has higher priority, we exclude the "Live coding on Rust".
5. **Async Python talk**: This event starts at 19:41 and ends at 20:11. It does not conflict with any other event.
6. **AI keynote**: This event starts at 20:26 and ends at 22:26. It conflicts with the "Async Python talk". Since the "Async Python talk" has lower priority, we exclude the "AI keynote".
7. **Networking with engineers**: This event starts at 22:12 and ends at 23:42. It conflicts with the "AI keynote". Since the "AI keynote" has been excluded, this event fits into the schedule without conflict.

### Final Schedule:

- 3D printing workshop (01:17 - 01:47)
- Trying new VR headset (09:48 - 11:03)
- Async Python talk (19:41 - 20:11)
- Networking with engineers (22:12 - 23:42)

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
