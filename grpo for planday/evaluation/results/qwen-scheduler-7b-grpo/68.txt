First, let's analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given rules:

1. **Chess with Daniel**: 04:51 - 06:36 (Priority = 2)
2. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 08:20 - 10:05 (Weight = 1)
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 08:39 - 08:54 (Weight = 1)
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike**: 11:30 - 11:45 (Weight = 1)
5. **Quantum computing guest talk**: 14:01 - 14:16 (Weight = 1)
6. **Office hours with Prof. Chen**: 14:01 - 15:46 (Priority = 2)
7. **Researching in library**: 19:40 - 19:55 (Weight = 1)

Given that we need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints, let's consider the following steps:

1. Place the high-priority events first:
   - Chess with Daniel (04:51 - 06:36)
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen (14:01 - 15:46)

2. Next, place other events ensuring no overlaps and considering their weights:
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (08:20 - 10:05): This conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture (08:39 - 08:54). Since both have the same weight, we'll keep the longer one.
     - We choose the Calculus lecture (08:20 - 10:05).
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (11:30 - 11:45): Fits after the Calculus lecture.
   - Quantum computing guest talk (14:01 - 14:16): Conflicts with Office hours with Prof. Chen. Since Office hours have higher priority, we exclude the guest talk.
   - Researching in library (19:40 - 19:55): Fits after the study session.

By following these steps, we ensure that all high-priority events are included, and we've maximized the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
