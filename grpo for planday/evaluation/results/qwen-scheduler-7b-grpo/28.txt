To create an optimized schedule, I'll first list all events and prioritize them according to the given rules. Since the "3D printing workshop" has a high priority, we need to ensure it's included in the schedule without causing any conflicts. Let's analyze the schedule step-by-step:

1. **AI keynote (00:12 - 01:57)**: This is a normal event and should be scheduled as is.
2. **Digital detox meditation session (01:01 - 02:01)**: This overlaps with the AI keynote. Since the AI keynote has a lower priority, we will exclude this event.
3. **Live coding on Rust (02:58 - 03:58)**: This is a normal event and should be scheduled as is.
4. **Trying new VR headset (05:51 - 07:36)**: This is a normal event and should be scheduled as is.
5. **3D printing workshop (07:57 - 09:57)**: This is a priority event and should be included in the schedule.
6. **Web3 panel discussion (19:20 - 20:05)**: This is a normal event and should be scheduled as is.
7. **Drone building hackathon (19:46 - 21:16)**: This overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion. Since the Web3 panel discussion has a lower priority, we will exclude this event.
8. **Small Language Models talk (21:50 - 22:05)**: This is a normal event and should be scheduled as is.

By following these steps, we ensure that the priority event (3D printing workshop) is included, and no overlaps occur.
