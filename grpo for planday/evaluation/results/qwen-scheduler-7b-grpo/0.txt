To create an optimized schedule that respects the given rules and priorities, I'll first list out all the events and their weights:

1. The Killers concert (00:22 - 00:37) - Weight = 1
2. Sum 41 concert (02:19 - 03:04) - Weight = 1
3. Jam session (07:47 - 09:17) - Weight = 1
4. Backstage tour VIP pass (09:08 - 09:23) - Weight = 2
5. Fireworks (12:27 - 13:12) - Weight = 2
6. Korean BBQ food trucks (12:42 - 14:42) - Weight = 1
7. David Bowie tribute concert (17:31 - 18:16) - Weight = 1

Given the priorities, we need to ensure that "Backstage tour VIP pass" and "Fireworks" are included in the schedule if possible without causing any overlaps.

Let's start scheduling:

1. **The Killers concert** (00:22 - 00:37) - Weight = 1
2. **Sum 41 concert** (02:19 - 03:04) - Weight = 1
3. **Jam session** (07:47 - 09:17) - Weight = 1
4. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (09:08 - 09:23) - Weight = 2
   - This fits perfectly after the Jam session without overlapping.
5. **Fireworks** (12:27 - 13:12) - Weight = 2
   - This fits between the Korean BBQ food trucks and the David Bowie tribute concert without overlapping.
6. **Korean BBQ food trucks** (12:42 - 14:42) - Weight = 1
   - This overlaps with Fireworks, so we exclude it.
7. **David Bowie tribute concert** (17:31 - 18:16) - Weight = 1

By excluding the Korean BBQ food trucks, we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
