To optimize the schedule while respecting the given rules, we need to prioritize the events based on their importance and ensure no overlaps occur. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

1. **Identify Prioritized Events**: 
   - "Reading 'Dune'" (14:47 - 15:17) - Weight = 2
   - "Walking with Bella" (08:22 - 09:07) - Weight = 2

2. **Check Overlaps**:
   - Ensure that the prioritized events do not overlap with each other.
   - Ensure that no other event overlaps with the prioritized events.

3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**:
   - Include as many high-priority events as possible without causing any overlaps.

Let's evaluate the events chronologically:

- **01:48 - 03:18**: Shopping at farmer's market (Weight = 1)
- **08:22 - 09:07**: Walking with Bella (Weight = 2)
- **14:47 - 15:17**: Reading 'Dune' (Weight = 2)
- **15:48 - 16:33**: Deep cleaning the kitchen (Weight = 1)
- **16:21 - 16:51**: Jogging at the park (Weight = 1)
- **17:29 - 19:29**: Planting flowers in the garden (Weight = 1)

From the above, we see that:
- "Walking with Bella" starts at 08:22 and ends at 09:07, which fits well before "Reading 'Dune'" starting at 14:47.
- "Reading 'Dune'" from 14:47 to 15:17 does not conflict with any other event.
- "Deep cleaning the kitchen" from 15:48 to 16:33 overlaps with "Jogging at the park" from 16:21 to 16:51. Since both have the same weight (1), we can choose either one. Let's exclude "Deep cleaning the kitchen" to maximize the duration of "Jogging at the park".

So, the optimized schedule will be:

- **01:48 - 03:18**: Shopping at farmer's market (Weight = 1)
- **08:22 - 09:07**: Walking with Bella (Weight = 2)
- **14:47 - 15:17**: Reading 'Dune' (Weight = 2)
- **16:21 - 16:51**: Jogging at the park (Weight = 1)
- **17:29 - 19:29**: Planting flowers in the garden (Weight = 1)

This schedule respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
