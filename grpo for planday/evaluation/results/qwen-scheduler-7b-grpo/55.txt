To create an optimized schedule, we need to consider the priorities and ensure that no overlaps occur while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations. Let's analyze the events:

1. **Fireworks (02:00 - 03:00)** - Weight = 1
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass (10:01 - 11:01)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Sum 41 concert (15:19 - 15:34)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
4. **Korean BBQ food trucks (15:39 - 17:09)** - Weight = 1
5. **The Killers concert (16:51 - 18:51)** - Weight = 1

Given the priorities and weights, we should prioritize the events as follows:

1. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (10:01 - 11:01) - Highest priority
2. **Sum 41 concert** (15:19 - 15:34) - Second highest priority

Now let's try to fit these events into the schedule without any overlaps:

- **Fireworks (02:00 - 03:00)** - Can remain as it is.
- **Backstage tour VIP pass (10:01 - 11:01)** - Fits after fireworks.
- **Sum 41 concert (15:19 - 15:34)** - Conflicts with Korean BBQ food trucks. We need to exclude one of them. Since Korean BBQ has a lower weight, we exclude it.
- **The Killers concert (16:51 - 18:51)** - Fits after Sum 41 concert.

So, the optimized schedule would be:
