To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: 
   - "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" (weight = 2)
   - "Marketing standup on Zoom" (weight = 2)

2. **Arrange Priority Events**:
   - Both priority events have the same weight and need to be placed in chronological order without overlap.
   - The "Marketing standup on Zoom" starts at 02:08 and ends at 02:23.
   - The "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" starts at 07:44 and ends at 09:44.

3. **Insert Normal Events**:
   - "One-on-one with manager" (04:30 - 05:45): This event falls between the two priority events and should be inserted without overlapping either.
   - "Analyzing product performance" (11:08 - 13:08): This event fits after the first priority event and before the second.
   - "Preparing PTO handover" (14:20 - 16:20): This event fits after the second priority event.
   - "Meeting with Lisa at café" (17:44 - 19:14): This event fits after the preparing PTO handover event.
   - "Replying to emails" (18:05 - 20:05): This event conflicts with the meeting with Lisa. Since the meeting has a higher weight, it will remain, and we will exclude the email reply.

4. **Final Schedule Check**:
   - Ensure no overlaps exist.
   - Verify that all priority events are included.
   - Confirm that the total weighted duration is maximized.
