To create an optimized schedule, we need to ensure that the priority event (Quantum computing guest talk) is included and any conflicting events are either removed or adjusted according to the rules.

Here's the initial list of events with their weights:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (02:35 - 04:35) [Weight: 1]
2. Group study for physics test (08:38 - 09:53) [Weight: 1]
3. Chemistry experiment (09:27 - 09:42) [Weight: 1]
4. Quantum computing guest talk (11:02 - 12:17) [Weight: 2]

The Quantum computing guest talk has the highest priority, so it should be included in the schedule. Let's check for conflicts:

- The Structural Dynamics lecture is from 02:35 to 04:35.
- The Group study for physics test is from 08:38 to 09:53.
- The Chemistry experiment is from 09:27 to 09:42, which conflicts with the Group study. Since both have the same weight, we need to remove one of them. We will keep the Group study as it ends later.
- The Quantum computing guest talk is from 11:02 to 12:17, which does not conflict with any other event.

So, the optimized schedule will include:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (02:35 - 04:35)
2. Group study for physics test (08:38 - 09:53)
3. Quantum computing guest talk (11:02 - 12:17)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all rules.
