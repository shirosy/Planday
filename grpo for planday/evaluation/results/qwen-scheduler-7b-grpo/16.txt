To optimize the schedule while respecting all rules and priorities, let's first identify the constraints and then arrange the events accordingly.

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (09:38 - 10:53) has the highest priority (weight = 2).
2. Other events have a weight of 1.
3. We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping events.

Given that the marketing standup is already scheduled from 09:38 to 10:53, we should try to fit other events around it without causing any overlaps.

Let's draft a possible schedule:

- **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick**: 01:34 - 03:19 (Weight = 1)
- **Q1 revenue report writing**: 01:47 - 02:32 (Weight = 1)
- **Marketing standup on Zoom**: 09:38 - 10:53 (Weight = 2)
- **Client call with Acme Corp**: 14:12 - 15:42 (Weight = 1)
- **One-on-one with manager**: 14:13 - 15:43 (Weight = 1)
- **Preparing PTO handover**: 19:30 - 21:00 (Weight = 1)

Upon reviewing, we see that there is a conflict between the client call and the one-on-one with the manager. Since both have a weight of 1, we need to exclude one of them to avoid overlap. Given that the one-on-one with the manager starts at 14:13 and ends at 15:43, which is slightly later than the client call, it would be better to exclude the client call to allow more time for the one-on-one session.

Final draft:
- **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick**: 01:34 - 03:19 (Weight = 1)
- **Q1 revenue report writing**: 01:47 - 02:32 (Weight = 1)
- **Marketing standup on Zoom**: 09:38 - 10:53 (Weight = 2)
- **One-on-one with manager**: 14:13 - 15:43 (Weight = 1)
- **Preparing PTO handover**: 19:30 - 21:00 (Weight = 1)

This schedule respects all rules and prioritizes the marketing standup while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.
