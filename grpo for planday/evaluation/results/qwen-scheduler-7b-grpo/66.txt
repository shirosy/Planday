To create the optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations. The priority event is "Cooking pasta" which has a weight of 2.

Let's analyze the events:

1. **Watching 'Inception' (01:27 - 02:57)**: Weight = 1
2. **Cooking pasta (07:18 - 07:33)**: Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Planting flowers in the garden (11:25 - 12:40)**: Weight = 1
4. **Shopping at farmer's market (12:53 - 14:08)**: Weight = 1
5. **Reading 'Dune' (13:02 - 13:17)**: Weight = 1
6. **Walking with Bella (13:19 - 15:04)**: Weight = 1
7. **Yoga class with Emily (15:45 - 17:15)**: Weight = 1
8. **Jogging at the park (16:54 - 17:09)**: Weight = 1

Since "Cooking pasta" is the only priority event, it should not be moved or removed. Let's see how we can fit the other events around it without overlapping:

- **Watching 'Inception'** (01:27 - 02:57): This event fits before "Cooking pasta".
- **Planting flowers in the garden** (11:25 - 12:40): This event fits after "Shopping at farmer's market" (12:53 - 14:08).
- **Shopping at farmer's market** (12:53 - 14:08): Fits between "Planting flowers in the garden" and "Reading 'Dune'".
- **Reading 'Dune'** (13:02 - 13:17): Fits immediately after "Shopping at farmer's market".
- **Walking with Bella** (13:19 - 15:04): Fits immediately after "Reading 'Dune'".
- **Yoga class with Emily** (15:45 - 17:15): Fits after "Walking with Bella", but there is a conflict with "Jogging at the park" (16:54 - 17:09). Since "Yoga class with Emily" has a lower weight, it will be excluded.
- **Jogging at the park** (16:54 - 17:09): Fits after "Yoga class with Emily".

Final schedule without conflicts:
1. Watching 'Inception' (01:27 - 02:57)
2. Cooking pasta (07:18 - 07:33)
3. Planting flowers in the garden (11:25 - 12:40)
4. Shopping at farmer's market (12:53 - 14:08)
5. Reading 'Dune' (13:02 - 13:17)
6. Walking with Bella (13:19 - 15:04)
7. Jogging at the park (16:54 - 17:09)

The sum of weighted event durations is:
- Watching 'Inception': 1 * (02:57 - 01:27) = 1 * 1 hour 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
- Cooking pasta: 2 * (07:33 - 07:18) = 2 * 15 minutes = 0.3 hours
- Planting flowers in the garden: 1 * (12:40 - 11:25) = 1 * 1 hour 15 minutes = 1.25 hours
- Shopping at farmer's market: 1 * (14:08 - 12:53) = 1 * 1 hour 15 minutes = 1.25 hours
- Reading 'Dune': 1 * (13:17 - 13:02) = 1 * 15 minutes = 0.25 hours
- Walking with Bella: 1 * (15:04 - 13:19) = 1 * 1 hour 45 minutes = 1.75 hours
- Jogging at the park: 1 * (17:09 - 16:54) = 1 * 15 minutes = 0.25 hours

Total: 1.5 + 0.3 + 1.25 + 1.25 + 0.25 + 1.75 + 0.25 = 7.5 hours
