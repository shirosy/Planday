To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, I need to ensure that the priority event "Fireworks" is included at its exact start time of 00:14. Then, I will evaluate the other events to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Include Fireworks**: 
   - Start time: 00:14
   - End time: 01:44

2. **Evaluate remaining events**:
   - David Guetta DJ set (03:01 - 04:16): This does not overlap with Fireworks and has a duration of 1 hour 15 minutes.
   - Silent disco party (10:15 - 12:00): This overlaps with the Jam session (10:46 - 12:46). We should choose the one with higher weight.
   - Jam session (10:46 - 12:46): Weight = 2
   - Sum 41 concert (11:00 - 13:00): This overlaps with the Jam session. Since Jam session has higher weight, we exclude Sum 41 concert.
   - The Killers concert (13:15 - 13:45): This does not overlap with any previous event and has a duration of 30 minutes.
   - Korean BBQ food trucks (19:05 - 21:05): This does not overlap with any previous event and has a duration of 1 hour.
   - Backstage tour VIP pass (21:56 - 23:41): This does not overlap with any previous event and has a duration of 1 hour 45 minutes.

3. **Final Schedule**:
   - Fireworks (00:14 - 01:44) [Weight = 2]
   - David Guetta DJ set (03:01 - 04:16) [Weight = 1]
   - Jam session (10:46 - 12:46) [Weight = 2]
   - The Killers concert (13:15 - 13:45) [Weight = 1]
   - Korean BBQ food trucks (19:05 - 21:05) [Weight = 1]
   - Backstage tour VIP pass (21:56 - 23:41) [Weight = 1]

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
