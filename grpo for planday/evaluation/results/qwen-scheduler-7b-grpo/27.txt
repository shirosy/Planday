To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, we need to carefully consider the constraints and prioritize the events accordingly. Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: 
   - "Live coding on Rust" (weight = 2)
   - "AI keynote" (weight = 2)

2. **Respect Chronological Order**:
   - All events must start at their specified times and cannot be adjusted.

3. **Maximize Weighted Event Duration**:
   - We should include as many priority events as possible without overlapping.

4. **Handle Conflicts**:
   - If there is a conflict between a priority event and a normal event, we must choose the priority event.

Let's analyze the events and see how we can fit them into a schedule:

- **AI keynote (00:20 - 00:50)**: This is a priority event.
- **Small Language Models talk (00:41 - 01:26)**: This conflicts with the AI keynote. Since it has lower priority, we exclude it.
- **Live coding on Rust (04:42 - 06:27)**: This is a priority event.
- **Web3 panel discussion (13:42 - 14:27)**: This is not conflicting with any other events and is not a priority, so we can include it.
- **Async Python talk (15:39 - 17:09)**: This is not conflicting with any other events and is not a priority, so we can include it.
- **Digital detox meditation session (16:16 - 18:01)**: This conflicts with the Async Python talk. Since it has lower priority, we exclude it.
- **Drone building hackathon (18:53 - 20:08)**: This is not conflicting with any other events and is not a priority, so we can include it.

By following these steps, we ensure that we maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the rules.
