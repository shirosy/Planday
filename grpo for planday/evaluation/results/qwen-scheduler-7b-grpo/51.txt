To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints, we need to prioritize the "AI keynote" event and ensure that no overlaps occur. Let's evaluate the events:

1. **Async Python talk (08:21 - 09:21)** - Weight = 1
2. **AI keynote (10:47 - 11:47)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
3. **Web3 panel discussion (11:45 - 12:15)** - Weight = 1
4. **Drone building hackathon (12:26 - 14:11)** - Weight = 1

Given that the "AI keynote" has a higher weight and must not overlap with any other event, we need to exclude the "Web3 panel discussion" because it conflicts with the "AI keynote".

So, the optimized schedule will include:
- Async Python talk (08:21 - 09:21)
- AI keynote (10:47 - 11:47)
- Drone building hackathon (12:26 - 14:11)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while adhering to all rules.
