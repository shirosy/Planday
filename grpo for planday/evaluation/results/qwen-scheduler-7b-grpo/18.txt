To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the "Analyzing product performance" event as it has the highest weight (2). We also need to ensure that no overlapping events occur and that the schedule respects the chronological order of all events.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The "Analyzing product performance" event from 13:41 - 14:41 has the highest priority.
2. **Check for Conflicts**:
   - The "Meeting with Lisa at café" from 12:29 - 14:14 conflicts with the "Analyzing product performance" event. Since the "Analyzing product performance" event has a higher priority, we will exclude the "Meeting with Lisa at café".
   - The "Replying to emails" from 04:03 - 04:48 does not conflict with any other events.
   - The "One-on-one with manager" from 02:30 - 04:15 ends before the "Replying to emails" starts, so there is no conflict here.
   - The "Preparing PTO handover" from 18:46 - 20:01 does not conflict with any other events.
3. **Construct the Schedule**:
   - Start with the "One-on-one with manager" from 02:30 - 04:15.
   - Followed by "Replying to emails" from 04:03 - 04:48.
   - Then, include the "Analyzing product performance" from 13:41 - 14:41.
   - Finally, add the "Preparing PTO handover" from 18:46 - 20:01.

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
