To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given constraints, let's analyze the events and prioritize them accordingly:

1. **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: This event has a high priority (weight = 2).
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen**: This event has a low priority (weight = 1).
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: This event has a medium priority (weight = 1).
4. **Chess with Daniel**: This event has the highest priority (weight = 2).
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: This event has a medium priority (weight = 1).

Given the priorities and absolute time constraints, we need to ensure that high-priority events do not overlap and are placed as early as possible without violating any rules.

### Step-by-Step Schedule Creation

1. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55)**: This is a high-priority event and should be scheduled first.
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45)**: This event overlaps with the Meeting with Emma and Jake. Since it has a lower priority, it cannot be included in the schedule.
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26)**: This event follows the Meeting with Emma and Jake and does not conflict with any other high-priority events.
4. **Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13)**: This event overlaps with the Structural Dynamics lecture. Since it has the highest priority, it will replace the part of the lecture that overlaps with it (from 07:43 to 08:13). The remaining part of the lecture (06:56 - 07:43) will remain.
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58)**: This event has no conflicts with any other events and can be scheduled as is.

### Final Schedule

- **Meeting with Emma and Jake**: 04:55 - 06:55
- **Structural Dynamics lecture**: 06:56 - 07:43
- **Chess with Daniel**: 07:43 - 08:13
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 14:13 - 14:58

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints.
