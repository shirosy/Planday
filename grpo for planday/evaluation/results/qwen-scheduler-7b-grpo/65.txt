To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints, let's analyze the events and priorities step by step:

1. **Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52)** - Weight = 1
2. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52)** - Weight = 1
3. **Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49)** - Weight = 1
4. **Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16)** - Weight = 2 (Priority)
5. **Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58)** - Weight = 1
6. **One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49)** - Weight = 1

### Constraints:
- No overlaps allowed.
- Prioritize events with higher weights.
- Maintain chronological order.

### Analysis:
- The "Updating website content" event has a higher priority (Weight = 2).
- It cannot overlap with any other event, so it will take precedence over all conflicting events.
- We need to find a way to fit the other events around this priority event without causing any conflicts.

### Schedule Optimization:
1. **Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52)** - Fits within the day without conflict.
2. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52)** - Conflicts with the meeting. Since the meeting has higher weight, we exclude this brainstorming session.
3. **Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49)** - Fits within the day without conflict.
4. **Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16)** - Prioritized and non-overlapping.
5. **Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58)** - Conflicts with the updating website content. Since the updating website content has higher weight, we exclude this analysis session.
6. **One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49)** - Fits within the evening without conflict.

### Final Schedule:
- Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52)
- Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49)
- Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16)
- One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49)

This schedule respects the chronological order, maintains the highest priority for the "Updating website content," and avoids overlapping events.
