To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the events and their priorities.
2. Sort the events chronologically.
3. Evaluate the conflicts between events and prioritize based on weights.
4. Adjust the schedule as necessary to avoid overlaps and maximize the sum of weighted durations.

**Step 1: Identify Events and Priorities**
- Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)
- Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)
- Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)

**Step 2: Sort Events Chronologically**
The events are already sorted chronologically.

**Step 3: Evaluate Conflicts and Prioritize Based on Weights**
- Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39) [Weight: 1]
- Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37) [Weight: 1]
- Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45) [Weight: 1]
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56) [Weight: 2]

There are no direct conflicts between events. However, we need to ensure that the study session with Sarah and Mike is included if possible, as it has the highest priority.

**Step 4: Adjust Schedule**
Since there are no conflicts and the study session has the highest priority, we can include it in the schedule without any adjustments.

Final Schedule:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)
2. Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)
3. Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45)
4. Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
