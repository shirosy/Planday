To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize the group study for the physics test. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Group study for physics test**: This event starts at 05:08 and ends at 05:23. It has a priority weight of 2.
2. **Quantum computing guest talk**: This event starts at 06:57 and ends at 07:27. It has a normal weight of 1.
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture**: This event starts at 12:31 and ends at 14:31. It has a normal weight of 1.
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: This event starts at 13:08 and ends at 13:53. It has a normal weight of 1.
5. **Researching in library**: This event starts at 14:35 and ends at 16:20. It has a normal weight of 1.
6. **Chemistry experiment**: This event starts at 20:30 and ends at 22:15. It has a normal weight of 1.

Given the priority of the group study for the physics test, we need to ensure it doesn't conflict with any other events. Let's see how the schedule would look:

- **05:08 - 05:23**: Group study for physics test (Weight: 2)
- **06:57 - 07:27**: Quantum computing guest talk (Weight: 1)
- **12:31 - 14:31**: Structural Dynamics lecture (Weight: 1)
- **13:08 - 13:53**: Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (Weight: 1)
- **14:35 - 16:20**: Researching in library (Weight: 1)
- **20:30 - 22:15**: Chemistry experiment (Weight: 1)

The group study for the physics test is scheduled first because it has the highest priority. The other events fit into the schedule without overlapping, as required.

Now, let's calculate the total weighted duration:
- Group study for physics test: 2 minutes * 2 = 4 units
- Quantum computing guest talk: 30 minutes * 1 = 30 units
- Structural Dynamics lecture: 60 minutes * 1 = 60 units
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 45 minutes * 1 = 45 units
- Researching in library: 45 minutes * 1 = 45 units
- Chemistry experiment: 75 minutes * 1 = 75 units

Total weighted duration: 4 + 30 + 60 + 45 + 45 + 75 = 269 units

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
