To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the events and their priorities.
2. Sort the events chronologically.
3. Place priority events first if their actual start time is earlier.
4. Ensure no overlaps by including the event with the higher weight in case of conflicts.
5. Exclude non-priority events if necessary to meet the rules.

Given events and priorities:
- Analyzing product performance (01:11 - 01:56) - weight = 1
- Client call with Acme Corp (06:34 - 07:19) - weight = 1
- Marketing standup on Zoom (14:51 - 15:51) - weight = 2
- Q1 revenue report writing (15:19 - 16:04) - weight = 1

Step-by-step scheduling:

1. **Analyzing product performance (01:11 - 01:56)** - weight = 1
2. **Client call with Acme Corp (06:34 - 07:19)** - weight = 1
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (14:51 - 15:51)** - weight = 2
   - This event has a higher priority and should be placed before any other event that starts at 14:51.
4. **Q1 revenue report writing (15:19 - 16:04)** - weight = 1
   - This event overlaps with the Marketing standup on Zoom, so it cannot be included as it would violate the no-overlap rule.

By following these steps, we ensure that the highest priority event is included, and overlapping events are excluded when necessary.

Final Schedule:
