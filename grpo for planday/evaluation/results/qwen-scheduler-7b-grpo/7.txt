To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, I need to ensure that the 3D printing workshop is included and no other events overlap with it. Let's evaluate the events:

1. **Digital detox meditation session** (01:20 - 02:35): This event starts at 01:20 and ends at 02:35. It has a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes.
2. **Web3 panel discussion** (05:56 - 06:26): This event starts at 05:56 and ends at 06:26. It has a duration of 30 minutes.
3. **Live coding on Rust** (13:34 - 15:34): This event starts at 13:34 and ends at 15:34. It has a duration of 2 hours.
4. **3D printing workshop** (13:49 - 14:34): This event starts at 13:49 and ends at 14:34. It has a duration of 45 minutes.

The 3D printing workshop has a higher priority and must not overlap with any other event. Therefore, we need to remove any overlapping events or find a way to fit it in without conflict.

Let's try to fit the 3D printing workshop into the schedule:

- If we include the 3D printing workshop from 13:49 to 14:34, we need to exclude the live coding on Rust from 13:34 to 15:34 because it overlaps.

This leaves us with the following schedule:

1. **Digital detox meditation session** (01:20 - 02:35)
2. **Web3 panel discussion** (05:56 - 06:26)
3. **3D printing workshop** (13:49 - 14:34)

Now, let's calculate the total weighted duration:
- Digital detox meditation session: 1 hour and 15 minutes (1.25 hours * 1 = 1.25)
- Web3 panel discussion: 30 minutes (0.5 hours * 1 = 0.5)
- 3D printing workshop: 45 minutes (0.75 hours * 2 = 1.5)

Total weighted duration: 1.25 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 3.25

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all the rules.
