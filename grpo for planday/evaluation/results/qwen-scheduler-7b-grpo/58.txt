To create an optimized schedule, we need to consider the absolute start and end times of each event and prioritize them according to the given rules. We will ensure that no overlaps occur and that high-priority events are scheduled when possible without conflicting with other events.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all events with their start and end times:**
   - Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40)
   - Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58)
   - Drone building hackathon (05:59 - 06:59)
   - 3D printing workshop (12:08 - 12:23)
   - Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04)

2. **Identify priority events:**
   - Trying new VR headset (weight = 2)
   - Live coding on Rust (weight = 2)

3. **Schedule events while respecting the rules:**

   - **Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40):** This event starts at 00:55 and ends at 02:40. It does not conflict with any priority events.
   
   - **Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58):** This event starts at 02:28 and ends at 03:58. It overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion, which has a lower weight (1). Since it has a higher priority, we exclude the Web3 panel discussion and keep the Live coding on Rust.
   
   - **Drone building hackathon (05:59 - 06:59):** This event starts at 05:59 and ends at 06:59. It does not conflict with any priority events.
   
   - **3D printing workshop (12:08 - 12:23):** This event starts at 12:08 and ends at 12:23. It does not conflict with any priority events.
   
   - **Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04):** This event starts at 13:19 and ends at 15:04. It does not conflict with any priority events.

Given the constraints and priorities, the optimized schedule is as follows:

</think>
<schedule>
<event>
<name>Web3 panel discussion</name>
<start>00:55</start>
<end>02:40</end>
</event>
<event>

<start>02:28</start>
<end>03:58</end>
</event>

<name>Drone building hackathon</name>
<start>05:59</start>
<end>06:59</end>
</event>

<name>3D printing workshop</name>
<start>12:08</start>
<end>12:23</end>
</event>

<start>13:19</start>
<end>15:04</end>
</event>
</schedule>
