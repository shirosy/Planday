To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize events based on their weights and ensure that no overlaps occur. We will start by listing all events in chronological order and then apply the priority rule.

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (02:41 - 04:11) - Weight = 1
2. **One-on-one with manager** (04:59 - 06:14) - Weight = 1
3. **Client call with Acme Corp** (09:15 - 10:30) - Weight = 1
4. **Preparing PTO handover** (16:21 - 17:21) - Weight = 1
5. **Q1 revenue report writing** (19:34 - 21:19) - Weight = 1
6. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (20:04 - 21:04) - Weight = 2

Given the priority, the "Meeting with Lisa at café" has the highest weight and should not overlap with any other event. Let's analyze the potential conflicts:

- The meeting with Lisa starts at 20:04 and ends at 21:04. This overlaps with both the "Preparing PTO handover" (16:21 - 17:21) and the "Q1 revenue report writing" (19:34 - 21:19).

Since the "Meeting with Lisa at café" has the highest priority, we need to exclude either the "Preparing PTO handover" or the "Q1 revenue report writing". To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should exclude the "Preparing PTO handover" because it has a lower weight (1) compared to the "Q1 revenue report writing" (1).

Here’s the optimized schedule:

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (02:41 - 04:11) - Weight = 1
2. **One-on-one with manager** (04:59 - 06:14) - Weight = 1
3. **Client call with Acme Corp** (09:15 - 10:30) - Weight = 1
4. **Q1 revenue report writing** (19:34 - 21:19) - Weight = 1
5. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (20:04 - 21:04) - Weight = 2

This schedule respects the chronological order, avoids overlaps, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while including the priority event.
