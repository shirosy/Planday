To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll analyze the events and prioritize them according to the given weights.

### Events:
1. **Sum 41 concert** (06:38 - 08:23) [Weight: 1]
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (07:40 - 08:55) [Weight: 1]
3. **Jam session** (10:02 - 10:47) [Weight: 1]
4. **David Bowie tribute concert** (10:12 - 10:42) [Weight: 1]
5. **Fireworks** (17:50 - 18:05) [Weight: 2]
6. **Avril Lavigne concert** (18:29 - 19:59) [Weight: 2]
7. **David Guetta DJ set** (20:11 - 21:26) [Weight: 1]

### Priorities:
- **Fireworks** [Weight: 2]
- **Avril Lavigne concert** [Weight: 2]

### Analysis:
- **Sum 41 concert** and **Backstage tour VIP pass** have overlapping times (07:40 - 08:55). Only one can fit into the schedule.
- **Jam session** and **David Bowie tribute concert** also overlap (10:12 - 10:42). Only one can fit into the schedule.
- **Fireworks** and **Avril Lavigne concert** do not overlap and both are high-priority events. Both should be included.

### Schedule Construction:
1. **Sum 41 concert** (06:38 - 08:23) [Weight: 1] - This event starts first and has no conflicting priorities.
2. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (07:40 - 08:55) [Weight: 1] - Conflicts with Sum 41 concert, so it's excluded.
3. **Jam session** (10:02 - 10:47) [Weight: 1] - This event starts after the high-priority events.
4. **David Bowie tribute concert** (10:12 - 10:42) [Weight: 1] - Conflicts with Jam session, so it's excluded.
5. **Fireworks** (17:50 - 18:05) [Weight: 2] - High-priority event and fits well within the schedule.
6. **Avril Lavigne concert** (18:29 - 19:59) [Weight: 2] - Another high-priority event and fits well within the schedule.
7. **David Guetta DJ set** (20:11 - 21:26) [Weight: 1] - Fits well after the high-priority events.

### Final Schedule:
- Sum 41 concert (06:38 - 08:23) [Weight: 1]
- Jam session (10:02 - 10:47) [Weight: 1]
- Fireworks (17:50 - 18:05) [Weight: 2]
- Avril Lavigne concert (18:29 - 19:59) [Weight: 2]
- David Guetta DJ set (20:11 - 21:26) [Weight: 1]
