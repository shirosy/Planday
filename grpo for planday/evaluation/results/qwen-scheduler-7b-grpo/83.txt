To create an optimized schedule that respects all given constraints, let's analyze the events and priorities step-by-step:

1. **Shopping at farmer's market**: This event starts at 00:04 and ends at 02:04. It has a priority weight of 2.
2. **Cooking pasta**: This event starts at 08:47 and ends at 10:02. It has a normal weight of 1.
3. **Planting flowers in the garden**: This event starts at 20:17 and ends at 21:32. It has a normal weight of 1.
4. **Yoga class with Emily**: This event starts at 20:32 and ends at 21:02. It has a normal weight of 1.

Given the constraints, we need to ensure that no two events overlap, and priority events should be included if there are any conflicts.

### Analysis:
- The shopping event spans from 00:04 to 02:04, which means it will take up the first two hours of the day.
- The cooking pasta event starts at 08:47 and ends at 10:02, which does not conflict with the shopping event and has a lower priority.
- The planting flowers in the garden event starts at 20:17 and ends at 21:32, which also does not conflict with the shopping event and has a lower priority.
- The yoga class with Emily event starts at 20:32 and ends at 21:02, which conflicts with the planting flowers in the garden event. Since the yoga class has a lower priority, it should be excluded.

### Schedule:
- The shopping event (00:04 - 02:04) is included as it is a priority event.
- The cooking pasta event (08:47 - 10:02) is included as it does not conflict with the shopping event.
- The planting flowers in the garden event (20:17 - 21:32) is included as it does not conflict with the shopping event.

The yoga class with Emily event (20:32 - 21:02) is excluded because it conflicts with the planting flowers in the garden event and has a lower priority.
