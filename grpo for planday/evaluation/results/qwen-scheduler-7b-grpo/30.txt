To create an optimized schedule, I need to consider the absolute start and end times of each event, respect the chronological order, and prioritize the "Marketing standup on Zoom" event. Let's analyze the events step by step:

1. **One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32)**: This event starts at 01:17 and ends at 01:32. It has a weight of 1.
2. **Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07)**: This event starts at 02:37 and ends at 03:07. It has a weight of 1.
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13)**: This event starts at 11:43 and ends at 12:13. It has a weight of 2.
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:06 - 17:51)**: This event starts at 17:06 and ends at 17:51. It has a weight of 1.
5. **Replying to emails (18:55 - 19:10)**: This event starts at 18:55 and ends at 19:10. It has a weight of 1.
6. **Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30)**: This event starts at 19:30 and ends at 20:30. It has a weight of 1.
7. **Meeting with Lisa at café (19:58 - 21:58)**: This event starts at 19:58 and ends at 21:58. It has a weight of 1.

Given that the "Marketing standup on Zoom" event has a higher weight (2) compared to other events (1), we should prioritize it and ensure it does not conflict with any other events. 

Let's try to fit all events into the schedule while respecting the constraints:

- Start with the one-on-one with the manager from 01:17 to 01:32.
- Followed by preparing PTO handover from 02:37 to 03:07.
- Then, the "Marketing standup on Zoom" from 11:43 to 12:13.
- Next, brainstorming with Luke and Patrick from 17:06 to 17:51.
- After that, replying to emails from 18:55 to 19:10.
- Followed by the client call with Acme Corp from 19:30 to 20:30.
- Finally, the meeting with Lisa at the café from 19:58 to 21:58.

Upon reviewing, we see that there is a conflict between the client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30) and the meeting with Lisa at the café (19:58 - 21:58). Since both have the same weight (1), we need to exclude one of them to maximize the sum of weighted event durations. Given that the "Marketing standup on Zoom" has the highest weight, we should keep it and exclude either the client call or the meeting with Lisa.

Let's exclude the meeting with Lisa:

- Exclude the meeting with Lisa at the café (19:58 - 21:58).

Final schedule:
- One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32)
- Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07)
- Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13)
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:06 - 17:51)
- Replying to emails (18:55 - 19:10)
- Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
