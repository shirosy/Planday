To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, let's first list out the events and their priorities:

1. David Bowie tribute concert (03:24 - 04:39) [Priority]
2. Jam session (11:32 - 12:17)
3. Silent disco party (15:10 - 16:55) [Priority]
4. Sum 41 concert (15:21 - 16:21)
5. Avril Lavigne concert (21:57 - 22:27)

We need to ensure that:
- The schedule respects the chronological order.
- Priority events are not moved unless necessary.
- Events do not overlap.
- We maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Let's analyze the potential conflicts:

- The David Bowie tribute concert starts at 03:24 and ends at 04:39.
- The Silent disco party starts at 15:10 and ends at 16:55.
- The Sum 41 concert also starts at 15:21 and ends at 16:21.

Since the Silent disco party and the Sum 41 concert overlap, we must choose one of them. Given that the Silent disco party has a higher priority, it should take precedence over the Sum 41 concert.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. David Bowie tribute concert (03:24 - 04:39)
2. Jam session (11:32 - 12:17)
3. Silent disco party (15:10 - 16:55)
4. Avril Lavigne concert (21:57 - 22:27)

This schedule ensures:
- All events are in chronological order.
- The priority events are included.
- There are no overlapping events.

The total duration of the scheduled events is:
- David Bowie tribute concert: 1 hour 15 minutes
- Jam session: 45 minutes
- Silent disco party: 1 hour 45 minutes
- Avril Lavigne concert: 30 minutes

Total: 3 hours 30 minutes
