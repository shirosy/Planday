To create an optimized schedule that respects the given constraints and prioritizes the specified events, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The AI keynote and the Trying new VR headset are the highest priority events.
2. **Place Priority Events**: Place these events in their absolute start and end times as specified.
3. **Handle Conflicts**: If there are any conflicts due to overlapping times, prioritize the event with the higher weight (AI keynote).
4. **Include Other Events**: Include other events only if they do not conflict with the priority events and respect the chronological order.
5. **Maximize Weighted Durations**: Ensure the sum of weighted event durations is maximized.

Let's go through the events step-by-step:

- **Digital detox meditation session (02:36 - 03:06)**: This is a normal event and does not conflict with any priorities.
- **Trying new VR headset (05:33 - 06:03)**: This is a high-priority event and should be included.
- **Small Language Models talk (10:16 - 11:31)**: This event conflicts with the Live coding on Rust (10:40 - 11:10). Since the AI keynote has higher priority, we will exclude the Small Language Models talk.
- **Live coding on Rust (10:40 - 11:10)**: This event conflicts with the Small Language Models talk but is not affected by the AI keynote.
- **Web3 panel discussion (12:43 - 14:43)**: This is a normal event and does not conflict with any priorities.
- **AI keynote (16:22 - 17:52)**: This is a high-priority event and should be included.
- **Networking with engineers (18:33 - 20:03)**: This is a normal event and does not conflict with any priorities.
- **Async Python talk (18:51 - 19:06)**: This event conflicts with the Networking with engineers (18:33 - 20:03). Since the AI keynote has higher priority, we will exclude the Async Python talk.

Based on these considerations, the optimized schedule is as follows:
