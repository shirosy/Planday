To create an optimized schedule that respects all given rules and prioritizes the "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams," I'll analyze the events chronologically and ensure no overlaps while maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

1. **Researching in library (01:53 - 02:23)**: This is a normal event.
2. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (01:58 - 03:28)**: This event starts at 01:58 and ends at 03:28, overlapping with the research event. Since it has a higher priority, we exclude the research event.
3. **Chemistry experiment (15:21 - 17:21)**: This is a normal event.
4. **Structural Dynamics lecture (17:42 - 18:57)**: This event starts at 17:42 and ends at 18:57, overlapping with the chemistry experiment. Since it has a higher priority, we exclude the chemistry experiment.
5. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:49 - 19:34)**: This event starts at 18:49 and ends at 19:34, overlapping with the structural dynamics lecture. Since it has a higher priority, we exclude the study session.
6. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:40 - 22:55)**: This is a priority event.

Given these constraints, the optimal schedule would be:

- Office hours with Prof. Chen (01:58 - 03:28)
- Chemistry experiment (15:21 - 17:21)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (17:42 - 18:57)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:49 - 19:34)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:40 - 22:55)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all rules and priorities.
