To optimize the schedule while respecting all the given rules, we need to prioritize the "Chemistry experiment" event as it has a higher weight. We also need to ensure that no events overlap, and that the schedule remains in strict chronological order.

Here's the initial list of events:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (09:50 - 10:05)
2. Chemistry experiment (11:18 - 12:48)
3. Researching in library (20:24 - 22:24)
4. Office hours with Prof. Chen (21:46 - 22:01)

The Chemistry experiment starts at 11:18 and ends at 12:48. This means there is a gap between the end of the Chemistry experiment (12:48) and the start of the Researching in library (20:24). However, the Researching in library event does not conflict with any other events.

The Office hours with Prof. Chen start at 21:46 and end at 22:01, which conflicts with the Researching in library event that also starts at 20:24 and ends at 22:24. Since the Office hours have a lower weight than the Researching in library, we should exclude the Office hours from the schedule to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

So, the optimized schedule will include:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (09:50 - 10:05)
2. Chemistry experiment (11:18 - 12:48)
3. Researching in library (20:24 - 22:24)

This schedule respects all the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
