To create an optimized schedule while respecting the given rules, I need to prioritize the "Jogging at the park" event and ensure that it does not overlap with any other events. Let's analyze the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Jogging at the park**: This event starts at 03:34 and ends at 05:19. It has a weight of 2.
2. **Deep cleaning the kitchen**: This event starts at 03:39 and ends at 05:39. It has a weight of 1.
3. **Cooking pasta**: This event starts at 12:06 and ends at 12:21. It has a weight of 1.
4. **Shopping at farmer's market**: This event starts at 15:55 and ends at 17:40. It has a weight of 1.

Since the "Jogging at the park" event overlaps with the "Deep cleaning the kitchen," we must exclude one of them. Given that "Jogging at the park" has a higher weight, we will keep it and exclude "Deep cleaning the kitchen."

The remaining events are:
- Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)
- Cooking pasta (12:06 - 12:21)
- Shopping at farmer's market (15:55 - 17:40)

Now, let's calculate the total weighted duration:
- Jogging at the park: 05:19 - 03:34 = 1 hour 45 minutes (2 * 1 hour 45 minutes = 2 hours 30 minutes)
- Cooking pasta: 12:21 - 12:06 = 15 minutes (1 * 15 minutes = 15 minutes)
- Shopping at farmer's market: 17:40 - 15:55 = 1 hour 45 minutes (1 * 1 hour 45 minutes = 1 hour 45 minutes)

Total weighted duration: 2 hours 30 minutes + 15 minutes + 1 hour 45 minutes = 4 hours 30 minutes

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.
