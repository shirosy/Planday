To create an optimized schedule, I'll first identify the constraints and priorities. The key points are:

1. **Chronological Order**: Events must appear in the same order as they were listed.
2. **Priority Events**: "Meeting with Emma and Jake" has a higher priority and must not overlap with any other event.
3. **No Overlaps**: If two events conflict, the one with the higher priority should remain.
4. **Maximize Weighted Durations**: Prioritize events that have higher weights.

Given the events and their start and end times, let's analyze the potential conflicts:

- **Structural Dynamics lecture** (00:34 - 01:19): This event is relatively short and does not overlap with any other events.
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams** (01:20 - 03:20): This event starts right after the Structural Dynamics lecture and ends well before the next event.
- **Chemistry experiment** (08:12 - 09:57): This event does not overlap with any other events.
- **Meeting with Emma and Jake** (09:54 - 10:09): This event conflicts with the Chemistry experiment.
- **Chess with Daniel** (19:03 - 21:03): This event does not overlap with any other events.
- **Group study for physics test** (19:41 - 21:26): This event conflicts with the Chess game.

Since "Meeting with Emma and Jake" has the highest priority, it will take precedence over all conflicting events. Therefore, we need to exclude the Chemistry experiment and the Group study for physics test.

The optimized schedule will be:

1. Structural Dynamics lecture (00:34 - 01:19)
2. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:20 - 03:20)
3. Chemistry experiment (08:12 - 09:57) [Excluded]
4. Meeting with Emma and Jake (09:54 - 10:09)
5. Chess with Daniel (19:03 - 21:03)
6. Group study for physics test (19:41 - 21:26) [Excluded]

This schedule respects the chronological order, includes the priority event, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
