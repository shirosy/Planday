To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priorities**: Sum 41 concert and Silent disco party have higher weights.
2. **Check Overlaps**: Ensure no overlaps between events, prioritizing higher-weighted events in case of conflicts.
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: Include as many high-weight events as possible without violating the rules.

Let's analyze the events:

- **David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40)**: Normal event (weight = 1).
- **Silent disco party (11:50 - 13:05)**: High-priority event (weight = 2).
- **David Bowie tribute concert (12:17 - 12:32)**: Normal event (weight = 1), conflicts with Silent disco party.
- **Avril Lavigne concert (14:39 - 15:54)**: Normal event (weight = 1).
- **Sum 41 concert (15:52 - 16:22)**: High-priority event (weight = 2).

**Step-by-step Schedule Creation**:

1. **Include David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40)**: This is a normal event and starts first.
2. **Include Silent disco party (11:50 - 13:05)**: This is a high-priority event and fits without conflict.
3. **Skip David Bowie tribute concert (12:17 - 12:32)**: This conflicts with Silent disco party and has lower weight.
4. **Include Avril Lavigne concert (14:39 - 15:54)**: This is a normal event and fits after Silent disco party.
5. **Include Sum 41 concert (15:52 - 16:22)**: This is a high-priority event and fits after Avril Lavigne concert.

By following these steps, we ensure that the schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
