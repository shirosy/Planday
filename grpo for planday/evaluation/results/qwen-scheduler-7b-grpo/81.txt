To create an optimized schedule, we need to ensure that all events are placed in chronological order while respecting the weight of each event. The priority event should always take precedence over non-priority events in case of a conflict.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **List all events with their respective start and end times:**
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen (02:13 - 03:58)
   - Chess with Daniel (03:24 - 04:54)
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (07:49 - 08:19)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (12:58 - 14:43)

2. **Identify the priority event:**
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight = 2)

3. **Place the priority event first in the schedule:**
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (12:58 - 14:43)

4. **Check for conflicts with other events and place them accordingly:**
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen (02:13 - 03:58): This does not conflict with the calculus lecture.
   - Chess with Daniel (03:24 - 04:54): Conflicts with the office hours. Since the office hours have lower weight (1), exclude chess.
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (07:49 - 08:19): Does not conflict with any other events.

5. **Final schedule:**
