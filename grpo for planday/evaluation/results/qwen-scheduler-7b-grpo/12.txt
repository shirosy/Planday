To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, we need to carefully consider the constraints and priorities. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **List Events and Priorities**:
   - Researching in library (02:20 - 03:20)
   - Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17)
   - Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12)
   - Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31)
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (19:13 - 19:43)
   
   Priorities:
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams
   - Researching in library

2. **Initial Chronological Order**:
   The events are already in chronological order.

3. **Applying Priorities**:
   - The calculus lecture with Prof. Adams has a higher priority and must not be moved.
   - The researching in library also has high priority and should ideally not be moved either.

4. **Checking for Conflicts**:
   - There are no immediate conflicts between the high-priority events (calculus lecture and library research).
   - However, there is a conflict with the group study for the physics test (17:16 - 18:31) and the study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18). Since both have low priority, one must be removed.

5. **Maximizing Weighted Duration**:
   - We should keep the high-priority events intact and remove the lower-priority event that causes the least disruption to the schedule.
   - Removing the study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18) seems like the best option as it minimally impacts the overall schedule.

6. **Final Schedule**:
   - Researching in library (02:20 - 03:20)
   - Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17)
   - Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12)
   - Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (19:13 - 19:43)

This schedule respects all rules, maintains the chronological order, prioritizes the high-weight events, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
