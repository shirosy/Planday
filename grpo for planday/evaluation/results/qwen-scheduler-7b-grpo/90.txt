To optimize the schedule while respecting all constraints, we need to carefully consider the priorities and ensure no overlaps occur. Let's break down the steps:

1. **List Events**: 
   - Meeting with Lisa at café (02:40 - 04:40)
   - Client call with Acme Corp (04:47 - 05:17)
   - One-on-one with manager (08:26 - 10:26)
   - Analyzing product performance (12:12 - 13:42)
   - Preparing PTO handover (13:21 - 13:51)
   - Updating website content (15:29 - 15:44)
   - Marketing standup on Zoom (20:36 - 21:06)

2. **Prioritize Events**:
   - Marketing standup on Zoom (weight = 2)
   - Analyzing product performance (weight = 2)

3. **Check for Overlaps and Adjustments**:
   - Ensure that both priority events fit without overlap.
   - Remove any conflicting events if necessary.

4. **Optimize Schedule**:
   - Start with the earliest event and add subsequent events ensuring no overlaps and respecting priority.

Let's construct the schedule step-by-step:

- **Meeting with Lisa at café (02:40 - 04:40)**: This is a normal event, so it goes first.
- **Client call with Acme Corp (04:47 - 05:17)**: This overlaps with the meeting and cannot be scheduled.
- **One-on-one with manager (08:26 - 10:26)**: This is a normal event, so it goes next.
- **Analyzing product performance (12:12 - 13:42)**: This is a priority event and fits well after the one-on-one session.
- **Preparing PTO handover (13:21 - 13:51)**: This overlaps with the analyzing product performance and cannot be scheduled.
- **Updating website content (15:29 - 15:44)**: This is a normal event, so it goes next.
- **Marketing standup on Zoom (20:36 - 21:06)**: This is a priority event and fits well at the end of the day.

After removing overlapping events and ensuring priorities are respected, the optimized schedule is:
