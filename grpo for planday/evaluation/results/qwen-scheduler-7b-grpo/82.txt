To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their weights.
2. Sort the events based on their start times.
3. Iterate through the sorted list and add events to the schedule, prioritizing longer events and excluding any conflicting events.
4. Ensure no overlaps and that priority events are included when conflicts arise.

Priority Events:
- Drone building hackathon (weight = 2)
- AI keynote (weight = 2)

Sorted Events:
1. AI keynote (03:20 - 05:20)
2. Async Python talk (10:33 - 11:33)
3. Small Language Models talk (10:43 - 12:43)
4. Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41)
5. 3D printing workshop (16:57 - 18:27)
6. Live coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20)
7. Drone building hackathon (19:32 - 21:17)
8. Trying new VR headset (21:23 - 21:38)

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. Add AI keynote (03:20 - 05:20) - Weight = 2
2. Add Async Python talk (10:33 - 11:33) - Weight = 1
3. Add Small Language Models talk (10:43 - 12:43) - This conflicts with Async Python talk, so skip it.
4. Add Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41) - Weight = 1
5. Add 3D printing workshop (16:57 - 18:27) - Conflicts with Networking with engineers, so skip it.
6. Add Live coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20) - Weight = 1
7. Add Drone building hackathon (19:32 - 21:17) - Weight = 2
8. Skip Trying new VR headset (21:23 - 21:38) as it conflicts with Drone building hackathon

Final Schedule:
- AI keynote (03:20 - 05:20)
- Async Python talk (10:33 - 11:33)
- Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41)
- Live coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20)
- Drone building hackathon (19:32 - 21:17)

Sum of weighted event durations: (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2) = 7 units
