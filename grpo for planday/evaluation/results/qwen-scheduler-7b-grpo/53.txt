To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all constraints, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and normal events.
2. Place the priority event first as it has higher weight.
3. Schedule other events around the priority event, ensuring no overlaps and maintaining chronological order.
4. If necessary, exclude non-priority events to avoid conflicts.

Given events and priorities:
- Priority: Chemistry experiment (21:02 - 22:02)
- Normal: Researching in library (03:27 - 03:57), Office hours with Prof. Chen (05:52 - 07:52), Structural Dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10), Study session with Sarah and Mike (21:13 - 23:13)

Let's start scheduling:

1. **Chemistry experiment** (21:02 - 22:02) - This is our priority event.
2. **Study session with Sarah and Mike** (21:13 - 23:13) - Conflicts with the chemistry experiment. We need to exclude one of these. Since study sessions generally have lower importance compared to experiments, we will exclude it.
3. **Office hours with Prof. Chen** (05:52 - 07:52) - Fits within the day without conflicting with any other events.
4. **Structural Dynamics lecture** (18:40 - 20:10) - Fits within the day without conflicting with any other events.
5. **Researching in library** (03:27 - 03:57) - Fits within the day without conflicting with any other events.

Final schedule:
- Researching in library (03:27 - 03:57)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (05:52 - 07:52)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10)
- Chemistry experiment (21:02 - 22:02)

This schedule respects all constraints, maintains chronological order, and includes the highest weighted event (Chemistry experiment).
