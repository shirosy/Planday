To create an optimized schedule while respecting all constraints, let's analyze the events step-by-step:

1. **Planting flowers in the garden (04:26 - 06:11)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour and 45 minutes.
2. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:56 - 07:56)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour.
3. **Calling Mom and Dad (09:05 - 10:20)**: This event has a duration of 1 hour 15 minutes.
4. **Shopping at farmer's market (12:33 - 13:18)**: This event has a duration of 45 minutes.
5. **Yoga class with Emily (13:02 - 15:02)**: This event has a duration of 2 hours.

The priority event is "Yoga class with Emily," which starts at 13:02 and ends at 15:02. Since it has a higher priority, it should be included in the schedule even if it conflicts with another event.

Let's evaluate the schedule:

- If we include the Yoga class from 13:02 to 15:02, it will conflict with the shopping at the farmer's market from 12:33 to 13:18. Therefore, the shopping event must be excluded to accommodate the yoga class.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. Planting flowers in the garden (04:26 - 06:11): 1 hour and 45 minutes
2. Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:56 - 07:56): 1 hour
3. Calling Mom and Dad (09:05 - 10:20): 1 hour 15 minutes
4. Yoga class with Emily (13:02 - 15:02): 2 hours

This schedule respects the chronological order, includes the priority event, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.
