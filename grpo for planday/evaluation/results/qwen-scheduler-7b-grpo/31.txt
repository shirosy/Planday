To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to ensure that the "Sum 41 concert" is included as it has the highest priority. We also need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.

Here's the initial list of events with their weights:
1. David Bowie tribute concert (03:15 - 03:30) - Weight = 1
2. Sum 41 concert (12:56 - 14:41) - Weight = 2
3. Jam session (21:44 - 21:59) - Weight = 1
4. David Guetta DJ set (21:54 - 23:24) - Weight = 1

Since the "Sum 41 concert" starts at 12:56 and ends at 14:41, it will occupy the slot from 12:56 to 14:41. This means the Jam session cannot fit into this time slot because it starts at 21:44 and ends at 21:59, which overlaps with the David Guetta DJ set starting at 21:54.

Therefore, we need to exclude one of the other events to make room. Since the Jam session has the least priority (Weight = 1), we should exclude it.

The final schedule will include:
1. David Bowie tribute concert (03:15 - 03:30)
2. Sum 41 concert (12:56 - 14:41)
3. David Guetta DJ set (21:54 - 23:24)

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while adhering to all the rules.
