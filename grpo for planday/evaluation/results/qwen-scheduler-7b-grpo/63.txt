To create an optimized schedule that respects all given constraints, we need to carefully consider the start and end times of each event and prioritize those marked as high-weight (Calculus lecture and Researching in library). Let's evaluate the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)**:
   - This event cannot be moved since it has a fixed start and end time.

2. **Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)**:
   - This event conflicts with the office hours. Since it has lower priority, it should be excluded.

3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)**:
   - This event does not conflict with any high-priority events and can remain.

4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)**:
   - This event is high-priority and should be included.

5. **Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)**:
   - This event is also high-priority and should be included. However, it conflicts with the group study session (14:23 - 14:53). To resolve this, we exclude the group study session.

6. **Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)**:
   - Excluded due to conflict with the high-priority research event.

7. **Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)**:
   - This event does not conflict with any other events and can remain.

Given these considerations, here is the optimized schedule:
