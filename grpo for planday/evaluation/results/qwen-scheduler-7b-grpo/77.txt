To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, I'll first identify the priority events and then place them in the schedule, ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

**Priority Events:**
1. AI keynote (11:39 - 13:24, weight = 2)
2. Networking with engineers (11:32 - 13:32, weight = 2)

**Normal Events:**
1. Live coding on Rust (00:23 - 01:23, weight = 1)
2. Digital detox meditation session (00:59 - 01:44, weight = 1)
3. Trying new VR headset (02:18 - 03:33, weight = 1)
4. Drone building hackathon (04:38 - 06:38, weight = 1)
5. Small Language Models talk (11:03 - 11:18, weight = 1)
6. Web3 panel discussion (18:19 - 19:49, weight = 1)

Given that the AI keynote and Networking with engineers overlap, we need to choose the one with higher weight. Both have the same weight, so we'll keep both and exclude the smaller one (Small Language Models talk).

Let's try to fit all events into the schedule:

1. **Live coding on Rust (00:23 - 01:23)**
2. **Digital detox meditation session (00:59 - 01:44)**
3. **Trying new VR headset (02:18 - 03:33)**
4. **Drone building hackathon (04:38 - 06:38)**
5. **AI keynote (11:39 - 13:24)**
6. **Networking with engineers (11:32 - 13:32)**

However, the AI keynote and Networking with engineers still overlap. Since they have the same weight, we'll exclude one. Let's remove the AI keynote as it ends later and doesn't conflict directly with any other events.

Final Schedule:
1. **Live coding on Rust (00:23 - 01:23)**
2. **Digital detox meditation session (00:59 - 01:44)**
3. **Trying new VR headset (02:18 - 03:33)**
4. **Drone building hackathon (04:38 - 06:38)**
5. **Small Language Models talk (11:03 - 11:18)**
6. **Networking with engineers (11:32 - 13:32)**
7. **Web3 panel discussion (18:19 - 19:49)**

This schedule respects all constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
