To optimize the schedule while respecting all rules and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations, we need to carefully consider the constraints and priorities. Let's break down the events and their weights:

1. **Networking with engineers** (05:39 - 06:09): Weight = 2
2. **AI keynote** (05:40 - 07:40): Weight = 1
3. **Web3 panel discussion** (14:56 - 16:26): Weight = 1
4. **Digital detox meditation session** (16:05 - 16:50): Weight = 1
5. **Async Python talk** (17:52 - 19:22): Weight = 2
6. **Trying new VR headset** (21:27 - 21:57): Weight = 1

### Analysis:
- **Networking with engineers** and **Async Python talk** have the highest priority (Weight = 2).
- **AI keynote**, **Web3 panel discussion**, and **Digital detox meditation session** have lower priority (Weight = 1).

Given that **Networking with engineers** starts at 05:39 and ends at 06:09, it will overlap with the **AI keynote** from 05:40 to 07:40. Since **Networking with engineers** has higher priority, we must exclude the **AI keynote**.

Next, **Async Python talk** starts at 17:52 and ends at 19:22. This event does not conflict with any other events and has high priority, so it should be included.

Now, let's re-evaluate the schedule considering these constraints:
- **Networking with engineers**: 05:39 - 06:09 (Weight = 2)
- **Web3 panel discussion**: 14:56 - 16:26 (Weight = 1)
- **Digital detox meditation session**: 16:05 - 16:50 (Weight = 1)
- **Async Python talk**: 17:52 - 19:22 (Weight = 2)
- **Trying new VR headset**: 21:27 - 21:57 (Weight = 1)

### Final Schedule:
The **AI keynote** overlaps with the **Networking with engineers**, so we exclude it. The **Async Python talk** fits perfectly without conflicting with any other events.
