To optimize the schedule while respecting the constraints and priorities, we need to ensure that the Avril Lavigne concert is included because it has the highest priority (weight = 2). We should also try to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.

Here's the initial list of events with their weights:
1. Fireworks (09:45 - 10:45) - Weight = 1
2. Silent disco party (09:50 - 11:05) - Weight = 1
3. Korean BBQ food trucks (12:16 - 13:16) - Weight = 1
4. David Bowie tribute concert (13:29 - 15:14) - Weight = 1
5. Avril Lavigne concert (17:25 - 18:25) - Weight = 2

Given that the Avril Lavigne concert is a priority, we need to ensure it fits into the schedule without conflict. Let's analyze the potential placements:

1. If we include the Avril Lavigne concert from 17:25 - 18:25, we cannot include any other events that overlap with this time slot.
2. This means we need to exclude one of the other events to make room for the Avril Lavigne concert.

Let's consider the possible exclusions:
- Excluding the Silent disco party (09:50 - 11:05) would leave us with:
  - Fireworks (09:45 - 10:45)
  - Korean BBQ food trucks (12:16 - 13:16)
  - David Bowie tribute concert (13:29 - 15:14)
  - Avril Lavigne concert (17:25 - 18:25)

This schedule respects all constraints and includes the priority event. Let's calculate the total weighted duration:
- Fireworks: 1 hour * 1 = 1
- Korean BBQ food trucks: 1 hour * 1 = 1
- David Bowie tribute concert: 1 hour 45 minutes * 1 = 1.75
- Avril Lavigne concert: 1 hour * 2 = 2

Total weighted duration = 1 + 1 + 1.75 + 2 = 5.75 hours

This schedule meets all the requirements and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
