First, let's list all the events and their priorities:

1. Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36) [Weight = 1]
2. The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38) [Priority = 2]
3. Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59) [Weight = 1]
4. David Guetta DJ set (19:50 - 20:50) [Priority = 2]
5. Jam session (19:50 - 20:50) [Weight = 1]

Given that David Guetta DJ set has a higher priority, we need to ensure it does not overlap with any other events. Similarly, The Killers concert also has high priority.

Let's analyze the schedule step-by-step:

1. **Fireworks**: This event starts at 00:06 and ends at 01:36. It has a weight of 1 and no conflicts with other events.
2. **The Killers concert**: This event starts at 00:08 and ends at 00:38. It has a priority of 2 and should not conflict with the fireworks. However, since it overlaps with the fireworks, we need to exclude one of them. Given the priority, we will keep The Killers concert and exclude the fireworks.
3. **Sum 41 concert**: This event starts at 15:29 and ends at 16:59. It has a weight of 1 and no conflicts with other events.
4. **David Guetta DJ set**: This event starts at 19:50 and ends at 20:50. It has a priority of 2. We need to check for conflicts. Since there are two events starting at the same time, we must choose the one with higher priority. Both have the same priority, so we need to decide which to exclude. Let's keep the first one encountered, which is the Jam session.
5. **Jam session**: This event starts at 19:50 and ends at 20:50. It has a weight of 1. As mentioned, we exclude this event because David Guetta DJ set has the same priority and is chosen first.

After considering the priorities and avoiding overlaps, our optimized schedule looks like this:

- Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36)
- The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38)
- Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59)
- David Guetta DJ set (19:50 - 20:50)

However, upon re-evaluating, we realize that the Jam session should be included instead of David Guetta DJ set because both have the same priority and we need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations. Therefore, the correct schedule is:

- Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36)
- The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38)
- Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59)
- Jam session (19:50 - 20:50)

This ensures that the highest priority events are included and there are no overlaps.
