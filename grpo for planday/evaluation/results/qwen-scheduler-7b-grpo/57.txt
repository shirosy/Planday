To create an optimized schedule, I need to ensure that the priority event (Yoga class with Emily) is placed as early as possible while respecting its absolute start time. I will then evaluate the other events to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the priority event**: Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13).
2. **Place the priority event** at its specified start time.
3. **Evaluate the remaining events** and decide which ones to include while ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

Let's analyze the events:

- **Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24)**: Conflicts with Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13). Since the priority event starts later, we exclude this event.
- **Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45)**: This does not conflict with any other events and has a weight of 1.
- **Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59)**: This conflicts with Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41). Since the priority event starts later, we exclude this event.
- **Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41)**: Conflicts with Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59). Since the priority event starts later, we exclude this event.
- **Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33)**: This does not conflict with any other events and has a weight of 1.

After evaluating the events, we have:

- Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13) [Priority, weight = 2]
- Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45) [Weight = 1]
- Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33) [Weight = 1]

The total weighted duration is \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\).
