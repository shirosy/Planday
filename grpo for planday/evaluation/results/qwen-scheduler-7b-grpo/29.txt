To optimize the schedule while respecting all the rules, I need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure no overlaps occur. Let's analyze the events and their priorities:

1. **Cooking pasta** (02:02 - 03:02) - Weight = 1
2. **Yoga class with Emily** (08:12 - 08:57) - Weight = 1
3. **Walking with Bella** (15:57 - 17:12) - Weight = 1
4. **Calling Mom and Dad** (17:35 - 19:35) - Weight = 2 (Priority)
5. **Planting flowers in the garden** (18:55 - 19:40) - Weight = 1
6. **Reading 'Dune'** (20:58 - 22:43) - Weight = 2 (Priority)

Given that "Calling Mom and Dad" and "Reading 'Dune'" have higher weights, we should try to fit them into the schedule without causing overlaps. 

Let's start scheduling:

- **Cooking pasta**: 02:02 - 03:02 (Weight = 1)
- **Yoga class with Emily**: 08:12 - 08:57 (Weight = 1)
- **Walking with Bella**: 15:57 - 17:12 (Weight = 1)
- **Calling Mom and Dad**: 17:35 - 19:35 (Weight = 2, Prioritize)
- **Planting flowers in the garden**: 18:55 - 19:40 (Conflicts with "Calling Mom and Dad", exclude)
- **Reading 'Dune'**: 20:58 - 22:43 (Weight = 2, Prioritize)

By excluding "Planting flowers in the garden," we ensure there is no overlap between "Calling Mom and Dad" and "Reading 'Dune.'"
