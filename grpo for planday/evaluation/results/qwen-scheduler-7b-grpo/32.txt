To create an optimized schedule that respects all the given rules, we need to prioritize the client call with Acme Corp and ensure it does not overlap with any other events. Let's evaluate the events step by step:

1. **Client call with Acme Corp**: This event starts at 06:20 and ends at 07:35. It has a weight of 2.
2. **Analyzing product performance**: This event starts at 13:27 and ends at 15:12. It has a weight of 1.
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom**: This event starts at 14:37 and ends at 15:52. It has a weight of 1.
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick**: This event starts at 19:12 and ends at 19:57. It has a weight of 1.

First, let's place the client call with Acme Corp as it is the highest priority event:
- **Client call with Acme Corp**: 06:20 - 07:35

Next, we need to fit the remaining events into the schedule without overlapping and respecting the weights:

- **Analyzing product performance**: This event starts at 13:27 and ends at 15:12. It fits well after the marketing standup.
- **Marketing standup on Zoom**: This event starts at 14:37 and ends at 15:52. However, it conflicts with the analyzing product performance event. Since the marketing standup has a lower weight (1), we exclude it.
- **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick**: This event starts at 19:12 and ends at 19:57. It fits well after the analyzing product performance.

Thus, the optimized schedule is:
