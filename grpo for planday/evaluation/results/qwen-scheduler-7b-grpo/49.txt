To optimize the schedule while respecting the given constraints, we need to carefully consider the timing and priorities of each event. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it:

1. **Cooking pasta** (02:12 - 02:27): This event starts at 02:12 and ends at 02:27.
2. **Shopping at farmer's market** (02:23 - 02:38): This event starts at 02:23 and ends at 02:38.
3. **Calling Mom and Dad** (06:02 - 08:02): This event starts at 06:02 and ends at 08:02.
4. **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (15:40 - 16:40): This event starts at 15:40 and ends at 16:40.
5. **Watching 'Inception'** (20:37 - 22:07): This event starts at 20:37 and ends at 22:07.

Given that "Deep cleaning the kitchen" has a higher priority (weight = 2), it should not overlap with any other event. We need to ensure that no other event interferes with it.

Let's evaluate the potential conflicts:
- **Cooking pasta** and **Shopping at farmer's market**: These two events do not overlap.
- **Calling Mom and Dad** does not conflict with either cooking or shopping.
- **Deep cleaning the kitchen** starts at 15:40 and ends at 16:40. There is no overlap with any other event.
- **Watching 'Inception'** starts at 20:37 and ends at 22:07. It also does not overlap with any other event.

Since all events respect the chronological order and there are no conflicts, we can include all events in the schedule without exclusion.

Final Schedule:
- Cooking pasta (02:12 - 02:27)
- Shopping at farmer's market (02:23 - 02:38)
- Calling Mom and Dad (06:02 - 08:02)
- Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:40 - 16:40)
- Watching 'Inception' (20:37 - 22:07)
