To create an optimized schedule, I'll first identify the priority event and then arrange the remaining events around it while respecting the rules provided. The priority event is "Meeting with Lisa at café" which starts at 00:21 and ends at 01:21.

1. **Meeting with Lisa at café**: This event is fixed at 00:21 - 01:21.
2. **Updating website content**: This event starts at 01:22, so it will immediately follow the meeting with Lisa.
3. **Q1 revenue report writing**: This event starts at 09:01, so it will be placed after the updating website content and before any other events that might conflict.
4. **Replying to emails**: This event starts at 16:06, so it will be placed after the Q1 revenue report writing.
5. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick**: This event starts at 17:25, but there's a conflict because the one-on-one with the manager also starts at 17:32. Since the one-on-one has a higher priority (weight = 2), we'll exclude the brainstorming session.
6. **One-on-one with manager**: This event starts at 17:32 and will replace the brainstorming session as it has higher priority.
7. **Preparing PTO handover**: This event starts at 20:07, so it will be placed after the one-on-one with the manager.
8. **Analyzing product performance**: This event starts at 21:19, so it will be placed after the preparing PTO handover.

By following these steps, we ensure that all events are scheduled in strict chronological order, no overlaps occur, and the priority events are respected.
