1. **Identify Priority Events**: The only priority event is the "Quantum computing guest talk" which starts at 03:56 and ends at 04:56.
2. **Maximize Weighted Event Durations**: Since the priority event is fixed, we need to ensure that non-priority events do not overlap with it and fit within the remaining time slots.
3. **Consider Overlapping Events**: Events must not overlap, and in case of a conflict, the higher-weighted event should be included.

Let's order the events based on their start times and ensure they meet all the constraints:
