To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given rules, I'll follow these steps:

1. List all events and their priorities.
2. Identify conflicts where there are overlapping times.
3. Prioritize higher-weight events over lower-weight events.
4. Adjust the schedule to remove any necessary events to avoid conflicts and maximize prioritize events.

Let's analyze the schedule:

1. Event 1: Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52), priority = 1
2. Event 2: Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52), priority = 1
3. Event 3: Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49), priority = 1
4. Event 4: Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16), priority = 2
5. Event 5: Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58), priority = 1
6. Event 6: One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49), priority = 1

**Conflict Analysis**:
- There are no time conflicts between events in the provided schedule.

**Maximizing Weighted Event Duration**:
Since there are no conflicts, we can focus on keeping as many high-priority events as possible. The high-priority event is "Updating website content" (Event 4).

**Optimized Schedule**:
Given that there are no conflicts and "Updating website content" is the only high-priority event, we should aim to include as much of it as possible.

1. Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52), priority = 1
2. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:52 - 03:52), priority = 1
3. Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49), priority = 1
4. Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16), priority = 2
5. Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58), priority = 1
6. One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49), priority = 1

This schedule includes all events and prioritizes "Updating website content" while respecting the rules.
