To create the optimized schedule, I need to ensure that the priority event (Yoga class with Emily) is included at its scheduled start time and weighs more than other events. I should also maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the constraints.

1. Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13) - Priority event, weight = 2
2. Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24) - Normal event, weight = 1
3. Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45) - Normal event, weight = 1
4. Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59) - Normal event, weight = 1
5. Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41) - Normal event, weight = 1
6. Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33) - Normal event, weight = 1

Since the Yoga class with Emily has a higher priority, it should be placed at its scheduled start time. The sum of weighted durations for all events is calculated as follows:

1. Yoga class with Emily: 01:00 * 2 = 02:00
2. Jogging at the park: 01:00 * 1 = 01:00
3. Cooking pasta: 00:30 * 1 = 00:30
4. Planting flowers in the garden: 00:30 * 1 = 00:30
5. Walking with Bella: 02:00 * 1 = 02:00
6. Shopping at farmer's market: 01:45 * 1 = 01:45

Total sum of weighted durations: 02:00 + 01:00 + 00:30 + 00:30 + 02:00 + 01:45 = 07:45

To maximize the sum of weighted durations without overlap, we should try to include as many events as possible within the constraints. Since the Yoga class with Emily must be included, we can start with it and then proceed with the other events.

The final schedule would be:

1. Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13)
2. Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24)
3. Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45)
4. Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59)
5. Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41)
6. Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33)
