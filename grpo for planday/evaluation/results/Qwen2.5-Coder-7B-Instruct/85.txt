First, let's review the events and their priorities:
1. Walking with Bella (00:59 - 02:59)
2. Shopping at farmer's market (02:34 - 03:34)
3. Calling Mom and Dad (06:59 - 07:44)
4. Jogging at the park (07:50 - 09:05)
5. Yoga class with Emily (10:11 - 11:11)
6. Watching 'Inception' (12:19 - 14:19)

Priority: Yoga class with Emily (weight = 2)

We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the chronological order and without overlaps. Since the Yoga class has the highest priority, it should be included if possible.

Let's consider the placement of the Yoga class:

- If we place the Yoga class at 10:11 - 11:11:
  - Walking with Bella: 00:59 - 02:59 (fits before)
  - Shopping at farmer's market: 02:34 - 03:34 (fits before)
  - Call Mom and Dad: 06:59 - 07:44 (fits before)
  - Jogging at the park: 07:50 - 09:05 (fits before)
  - Watching 'Inception': 12:19 - 14:19 (fits after)

This placement works as all events respect the chronological order and there are no overlaps. The Yoga class with Emily is included and has the highest priority.

Let's check the weighted sum of durations:
- Walking with Bella: 1 hour, weight = 1, so duration * weight = 60 * 1 = 60
- Shopping at farmer's market: 1 hour, weight = 1, so duration * weight = 60 * 1 = 60
- Calling Mom and Dad: 45 minutes, weight = 1, so duration * weight = 45 * 1 = 45
- Jogging at the park: 75 minutes, weight = 1, so duration * weight = 75 * 1 = 75
- Yoga class with Emily: 1 hour, weight = 2, so duration * weight = 60 * 2 = 120
- Watching 'Inception': 1 hour, weight = 1, so duration * weight = 60 * 1 = 60

Total weighted duration = 60 + 60 + 45 + 75 + 120 + 60 = 480
