I'll start with the priority events and see how they fit into the schedule without overlapping any other events and while maximizing the weighted duration.

1. **Backstage tour VIP pass** (09:08 - 09:23) with weight 2
2. **Fireworks** (12:27 - 13:12) with weight 2

Now, I need to place the other events around these and ensure no overlaps.

3. **Jam session** (07:47 - 09:17) with weight 1
4. **Sum 41 concert** (02:19 - 03:04) with weight 1
5. **The Killers concert** (00:22 - 00:37) with weight 1
6. **Korean BBQ food trucks** (12:42 - 14:42) with weight 1
7. **David Bowie tribute concert** (17:31 - 18:16) with weight 1

Let's place them in chronological order:

- **The Killers concert** can be placed from 00:22 - 00:37
- **Sum 41 concert** follows immediately at 00:37 - 02:19
- **Jam session** can be placed from 07:47 - 09:17, but there's a conflict with the Backstage tour VIP pass. We need to find another spot for it.
- **Fireworks** can be placed before the Korean BBQ food trucks at 12:27 - 13:12, but the Korean BBQ food trucks start at 12:42. Fireworks had to be adjusted to fit between other events.
- **Backstage tour VIP pass** remains the same at 09:08 - 09:23
- **Korean BBQ food trucks** are placed at a different time to avoid conflicts. They can start at 04:00 - 05:30 (making sure it doesn't overlap with any event).
- **David Bowie tribute concert** can be placed from 17:31 - 18:16

After final adjustments, the schedule looks like this:
