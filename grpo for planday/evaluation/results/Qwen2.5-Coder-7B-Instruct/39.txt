To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize the given events based on their importance (weight). The priority events are the AI keynote and the trying new VR headset. Since these events are already scheduled, I will ensure they are included without changing their start and end times. I will then consider the normal events and fit them into the schedule without overlapping and respecting the given constraints.

1. **AI keynote (16:22 - 17:52)** - Priority (weight = 2)
2. **Trying new VR headset (05:33 - 06:03)** - Priority (weight = 2)
3. **Small Language Models talk (10:16 - 11:31)**
4. **Live coding on Rust (10:40 - 11:10)**
5. **Web3 panel discussion (12:43 - 14:43)**
6. **Networking with engineers (18:33 - 20:03)**
7. **Async Python talk (18:51 - 19:06)**

I will place the priority events first and then fit the normal events around them.

1. AI keynote (16:22 - 17:52)
2. Trying new VR headset (05:33 - 06:03)
3. Small Language Models talk (10:16 - 11:31)
4. Live coding on Rust (10:40 - 11:10) - This overlaps with Small Language Models talk, so I will exclude it.
5. Web3 panel discussion (12:43 - 14:43)
6. Networking with engineers (18:33 - 20:03)
7. Async Python talk (18:51 - 19:06) - This overlaps with Networking with engineers, so I will exclude it.
