To create an optimized schedule, I will first sort the events by their start times and then place the priority events in their allocated time slots. I will then check for any conflicts and adjust the schedule accordingly. The goal is to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all rules.

Step 1: Sort events by start time. The sorted list is:
1. Researching in library (09:35 - 11:05)
2. Group study for physics test (10:41 - 10:56)
3. Office hours with Prof. Chen (12:39 - 13:24)
4. Study session with Sarah and Mike (12:55 - 13:40)
5. Structural Dynamics lecture (15:58 - 16:43)
6. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (18:06 - 19:51)

Step 2: Place the priority events in their allocated time slots.
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (12:39 - 13:24)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (18:06 - 19:51)

Step 3: Place the remaining events, respecting the rules and avoiding conflicts.
- Researching in library (09:35 - 11:05)
- Group study for physics test (10:41 - 10:56)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (12:55 - 13:40)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (15:58 - 16:43)


Step 4: Calculate the sum of weighted event durations.
- Office hours with Prof. Chen: 2 * (13:24 - 12:39) = 2 * 85 minutes = 170 minutes
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 2 * (19:51 - 18:06) = 2 * 95 minutes = 190 minutes
- Researching in library: 1 * (11:05 - 09:35) = 1 * 70 minutes = 70 minutes
- Group study for physics test: 1 * (10:56 - 10:41) = 1 * 15 minutes = 15 minutes
- Study session with Sarah and Mike: 1 * (13:40 - 12:55) = 1 * 85 minutes = 85 minutes
- Structural Dynamics lecture: 1 * (16:43 - 15:58) = 1 * 45 minutes = 45 minutes

Total weighted minutes = 170 + 190 + 70 + 15 + 85 + 45 = 565 minutes

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting all rules.
