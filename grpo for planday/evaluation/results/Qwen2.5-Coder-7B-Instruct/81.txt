To create an optimized schedule, we need to place high-priority events first to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping.

Given:
- Priority event: Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (12:58 - 14:43, weight = 2)
- Other events must be scheduled around this event.

1. The Calculus lecture has a high priority and is mandatory, so it will be scheduled between 12:58 and 14:43.
2. Office hours with Prof. Chen (02:13 - 03:58) and Study session with Sarah and Mike (07:49 - 08:19) are low priority events and can be scheduled before or after the Calculus lecture.
3. Chess with Daniel (03:24 - 04:54) overlaps with the Calculus lecture, so it can be excluded if needed since it has lower priority.

Let's schedule the events:

- Office hours with Prof. Chen (02:13 - 03:58)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (12:58 - 14:43)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (07:49 - 08:19)
