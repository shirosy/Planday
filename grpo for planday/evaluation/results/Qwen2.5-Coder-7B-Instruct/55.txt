1. **Identify the key rules and priorities:**
   - Chronological order.
   - Priority events (Sum 41 concert and Backstage tour VIP pass) have higher weight.
   - No overlap.
   - Maximize weighted event durations.

2. **List the events and their priority:**
   - Fireworks: 02:00 - 03:00
   - Backstage tour VIP pass: 10:01 - 11:01
   - Sum 41 concert: 15:19 - 15:34
   - Korean BBQ food trucks: 15:39 - 17:09
   - The Killers concert: 16:51 - 18:51

3. **Arrange the events based on priority and chronological order:**

   - **Sum 41 concert (15:19 - 15:34):** Highest priority, durin the Korean BBQ food trucks event period.
   - **Korean BBQ food trucks (15:39 - 17:09):** Cannot overlap with Sum 41 concert, so is placed after it.
   - **The Killers concert (16:51 - 18:51):** Cannot overlap with Korean BBQ food trucks, but can partially overlap with the Sum 41 concert. Since it starts later, it will be placed after the Sum 41 concert.
   - **Backstage tour VIP pass (10:01 - 11:01):** Cannot overlap with the Sum 41 concert, but can be placed before the Korean BBQ food trucks.
   - **Fireworks (02:00 - 03:00):** Can be placed at the end since no other events interfere.

4. **Final schedule:**

   - Sum 41 concert (15:19 - 15:34)
   - Korean BBQ food trucks (15:39 - 17:09)
   - The Killers concert (16:51 - 18:51)
