The goal is to create a schedule that optimizes the weighted event durations while respecting the given rules, including the priority event with Lisa. Let's analyze the events and their constraints:

1. **Q1 revenue report writing** (04:26 - 05:11) - weight = 1
2. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (04:53 - 05:08) - weight = 2 (priority)
3. **One-on-one with manager** (06:09 - 06:24) - weight = 1
4. **Preparing PTO handover** (12:27 - 13:57) - weight = 1
5. **Analyzing product performance** (15:09 - 16:54) - weight = 1
6. **Updating website content** (16:03 - 18:03) - weight = 1

Given that the priority event (Meeting with Lisa at café) cannot be moved, we need to schedule the other events around it while ensuring no overlaps and maximizing the sum of weighted event durations.

Let's place the priority event first:
- **Meeting with Lisa at café** (04:53 - 05:08)

Next, we can schedule the other events around this priority event:
- **Q1 revenue report writing** can start as early as possible (04:26) without overlapping the priority event.
- **One-on-one with manager** can follow after the priority event (05:11 - 06:09).
- **Preparing PTO handover** can start at 12:27, ensuring it doesn't overlap with the other events.
- **Analyzing product performance** can start at 15:09, following the PTO handover.
- **Updating website content** can start at 16:03, ensuring it doesn't overlap with the priority event and the product performance analysis.

Now, let's calculate the total weighted duration:
- Q1 revenue report writing: 04:26 - 05:11 (45 minutes)
- Meeting with Lisa at café: 04:53 - 05:08 (15 minutes)
- One-on-one with manager: 06:09 - 06:24 (15 minutes)
- Preparing PTO handover: 12:27 - 13:57 (90 minutes)
- Analyzing product performance: 15:09 - 16:54 (105 minutes)
- Updating website content: 16:03 - 18:03 (120 minutes)

Sum of weighted durations:
- Q1 revenue report writing: 45 minutes * 1 = 45
- Meeting with Lisa at café: 15 minutes * 2 = 30
- One-on-one with manager: 15 minutes * 1 = 15
- Preparing PTO handover: 90 minutes * 1 = 90
- Analyzing product performance: 105 minutes * 1 = 105
- Updating website content: 120 minutes * 1 = 120

Total weighted duration: 45 + 30 + 15 + 90 + 105 + 120 = 405 minutes

This schedule respects the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
