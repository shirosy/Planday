To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the rules, I need to prioritize the Quantum computing guest talk due to its higher weight. The schedule must be chronological and respect the absolute start and end times of each event. Let's draft theschedule step by step.

1. **Quantum computing guest talk (11:02 - 12:17)**
   - Weight: 2
   - This event has a higher priority, so it should be placed as soon as possible without conflicting with other events.

2. **Group study for physics test (08:38 - 09:53)**
   - Weight: 1
   - This event overlaps with the chemistry experiment, which is only 45 minutes long. Since the guest talk is before the chemistry experiment, we can include this event.

3. **Chemistry experiment (09:27 - 09:42)**
   - Weight: 1
   - This event conflicts with both the group study and the structural dynamics lecture. Since the guest talk is between 11:02 and 12:17, we can include this event between 09:53 and 09:42.

4. **Structural Dynamics lecture (02:35 - 04:35)**
   - Weight: 1
   - This event is the earliest and does not conflict with any other events, so it can be included.

Now, let's check if all events fit and there are no conflicts:
- 02:35 - 04:35: Structural Dynamics lecture
- 08:38 - 09:53: Group study for physics test (08:38 - 09:42) and Chemistry experiment (09:42 - 09:53)
- 11:02 - 12:17: Quantum computing guest talk

All events fit without any overlaps, and the Quantum computing guest talk is given priority.
