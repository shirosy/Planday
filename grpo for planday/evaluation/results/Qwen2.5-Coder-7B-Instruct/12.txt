First, let's list the events and their priorities:

1. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams - Priority 2
2. Researchersing in library - Priority 2
3. Chess with Daniel - Priority 1
4. Quantum computing guest talk - Priority 1
5. Group study for physics test - Priority 1
6. Study session with Sarah and Mike - Priority 1

We need to maximize the weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints. The two priority events are Calculus lecture and Researching in the library, both with a weight of 2.

Let's attempt to include both priority events in the schedule:

- The Calculus lecture is scheduled from 19:13 to 19:43.
- The Researching event should be scheduled before the Calculus lecture to respect the chronological order.
  - The latest possible start time for Researching in the library without overlapping with Calculus is 17:20 (since it ends at 17:30 and the Calculus lecture starts at 19:13).

Now let's place the remaining events:

- Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17)
- Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12)
- Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18)

We have one more slot for an event:
- Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31)

Thus, the optimized schedule is:

<schedule>
<event>
<name>Researching in library</name>
<start>02:20</start>
<end>03:20</end>

<event>
