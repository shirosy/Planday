Let's analyze the events and prioritize them based on the given rules and priorities.

1. The Live coding on Rust event is weighted with a priority of 2.
2. The AI keynote is also weighted with a priority of 2.
3. The Small Language Models talk event overlaps with the AI keynote and Live coding on Rust, and it is a normal event with a weight of 1.
4. Other events like the Web3 panel discussion, Async Python talk, Digital detox meditation session, and Drone building hackathon are normal events with a weight of 1.

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we need to include all high-priority events if possible, and then fit in as many normal events as we can without overlapping.

Here is the tentative schedule:

1. AI keynote (00:20 - 00:50) - Priority 2
2. Live coding on Rust (04:42 - 06:27) - Priority 2
3. Small Language Models talk (01:26 - 04:42) - Normal event, no conflict with high-priority events
4. Web3 panel discussion (13:42 - 14:27) - Normal event, no conflict with high-priority events
5. Async Python talk (15:39 - 17:09) - Normal event, no conflict with high-priority events
6. Digital detox meditation session (16:16 - 18:01) - Normal event, no conflict with high-priority events
7. Drone building hackathon (18:53 - 20:08) - Normal event, no conflict with high-priority events

All high-priority events are included, and there are no conflicts. The schedule respects chronological order and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
