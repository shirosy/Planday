To create the optimized schedule, let's reason through the constraints and priorities:

1. **Priority Event**: The "Drone building hackathon" (02:50 - 03:20) has a higher priority (weight = 2). It must be scheduled first if possible without causing conflicts.

2. **Overlap with Non-Priority Event**: The "3D printing workshop" (02:52 - 04:37) starts after the "Drone building hackathon" and ends before the "Networking with engineers" (06:16 - 06:31). To maximize weighted event durations, we should include this event.

3. **Conflict with Non-Priority Event**: The "Async Python talk" (09:41 - 11:41) overlaps with the "Trying new VR headset" (06:17 - 06:47) only by a short window. We need to decide which one to include based on their weights.

4. **Maximize Weighted Event Durations**: The "Live coding on Rust" (08:35 - 09:05) has a higher duration (30 minutes) than the "Async Python talk" (1 hour, 0 minutes).

Given these considerations, the optimized schedule should include:
- "Drone building hackathon"
- "3D printing workshop"
- "Live coding on Rust"

Let's construct the schedule:

1. **Drone building hackathon (02:50 - 03:20)**
2. **3D printing workshop (02:52 - 04:37)**
3. **Live coding on Rust (08:35 - 09:05)**

We need to exclude the "Async Python talk" and the "Networking with engineers" event to fit within the schedule constraints.
