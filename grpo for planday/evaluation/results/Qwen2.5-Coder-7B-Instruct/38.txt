To create an optimized schedule, I need to ensure that high-priority events are included and that no time slots overlap. Let's analyze the events and priorities:

1. **Digital detox meditation session (18:53 - 19:23)**
   - Priority: 2 (high)
   - Conflict with: Networking with engineers and Live coding on Rust

2. **AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35)**
   - Priority: 2 (high)
   - Conflict with: Async Python talk and Networking with engineers

3. **Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07)**
   - Normal event (weight = 1)
   - No immediate conflict

4. **Small Language Models talk (07:05 - 08:50)**
   - Normal event (weight = 1)
   - Conflicts with: Drone building hackathon

5. **Async Python talk (16:05 - 16:20)**
   - Normal event (weight = 1)
   - Conflict with: AI keynote

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting priorities, I will:
- Prioritize the Digital detox meditation session from 18:53 to 19:23.
- Remove the AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35) as it conflicts with the high-priority session.
- Include the Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07) as it has no conflicts.

The remaining events must fit without overlapping other priority events.
