The goal is to create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the chronological order and priority rules. The constraints are that priority events (Sum 41 concert and Silent disco party) must take precedence over normal events and there should be no overlaps. Events have specific start and end times that cannot be changed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Silent disco party (11:50 - 13:05)**
   - This event has a higher priority than the David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40).
   - If included, it must be at least 11:50.

2. **Sum 41 concert (15:52 - 16:22)**
   - This event also has a higher priority than the Avril Lavigne concert (14:39 - 15:54).
   - If included, it must be at 15:52 or later.

3. **David Bowie tribute concert (12:17 - 12:32)**
   - This event is weighted normally and overlaps with the Sum 41 concert.
   - Since Sum 41 concert is a priority event, it will take precedence.

4. **Avril Lavigne concert (14:39 - 15:54)**
   - This event overlaps with the Sum 41 concert.
   - Since Sum 41 concert is a priority event, it will take precedence.

5. **David Guetta DJ set (09:10 - 09:40)**
   - This event is normal and应该在Silent disco party之前。
   - It must start no later than 13:05 to make space for the David Bowie tribute concert and Avril Lavigne concert.

### Resulting Schedule Calculation:

1. Start with the Silent disco party from 11:50 - 13:05 (weight = 1).
2. Follow it with the David Bowie tribute concert from 12:17 - 12:32 (weight = 1).
3. The Avril Lavigne concert overlaps with the David Bowie tribute concert, so it will be scheduled from 14:39 - 15:54 (weight = 1).
4. The Sum 41 concert is a priority event and will be scheduled from 15:52 - 16:22 (weight = 2).

This schedule respects all rules, prioritizes events correctly, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
