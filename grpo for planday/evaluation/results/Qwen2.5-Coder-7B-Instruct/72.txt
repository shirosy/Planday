To create the optimized schedule, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority event and place it first.
2. Add the other events in chronological order.
3. Ensure no overlaps and that higher-weighted events are given priority in conflicts.

Given the rules, the priority event is the Quantum computing guest talk from 11:21 - 12:51. It needs to be placed first since it has the highest weight.

Now, let's add the other events in chronological order, respecting the constraints:

1. Quantum computing guest talk (11:21 - 12:51)
2. Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:44 - 15:14)
3. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (21:20 - 22:05)
4. Chess with Daniel (18:24 - 19:09)
5. Structural Dynamics lecture (21:35 - 22:20)

The schedule should look like this:
</think>
<schedule>
<event>
<name>Quantum computing guest talk</name>
<start>11:21</start>
<end>12:51</end>
