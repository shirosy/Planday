To optimize the schedule while respecting the given rules, I need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority event (Trying new VR headset) and place it in its absolute start and end time.
2. Place the other events in their absolute start and end times in chronological order.
3. Check for conflicts and adjust if necessary, prioritizing higher weight events.
4. Ensure no overlaps and include the event with higher weight in conflicts.
5. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

The priority event is "Trying new VR headset" from 16:47 - 17:17, which must be included.

Now, let's place the other events:
- Async Python talk (05:46 - 07:46)
- Live coding on Rust (06:39 - 08:09)
- AI keynote (11:39 - 12:24)
- 3D printing workshop (15:34 - 17:34)

The conflicting event with "Trying new VR headset" is the 3D printing workshop from 15:34 - 17:34, which overlaps completely with "Trying new VR headset".

We need to either exclude the "3D printing workshop" or the "Trying new VR headset". To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should exclude the "3D printing workshop" because it does not carry a priority and there is no event with a higher priority to conflict with it.

So, the final schedule will include:
- Async Python talk (05:46 - 07:46)
- Live coding on Rust (06:39 - 08:09)
- AI keynote (11:39 - 12:24)
- Trying new VR headset (16:47 - 17:17)
