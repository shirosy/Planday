Let's reason through the task inside <think> tags:

1. **Identify the Priority Event**: The priority event is the "Yoga class with Emily" with a weight of 2.

2. **Consider the Schedule Constraints**:
   - The yoga class is scheduled from 13:02 - 15:02.
   - This timeslot has a total duration of 1 hour and 10 minutes (60 + 10 = 70 minutes).
   - Prioritize this event as it has the highest weight.

3. **Compare with Other Events**:
   - **Planting flowers in the garden** (04:26 - 06:11): Duration = 1 hour 45 minutes, Start time = 04:26. Cannot start before 13:02 due to overlap with yoga class.
   - **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (06:56 - 07:56): Duration = 1 hour, Start time = 06:56. Cannot start before 13:02 due to overlap with yoga class.
   - **Calling Mom and Dad** (09:05 - 10:20): Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes, Start time = 09:05. This event does not conflict with the yoga class and has a priority of 1.
   - **Shopping at farmer's market** (12:33 - 13:18): Duration = 45 minutes, Start time = 12:33. This event does not conflict with the yoga class and has a priority of 1.

4. **Maximize Weighted Event Durations**:
   - The yoga class has the highest priority and must be scheduled.
   - Both shopping and calling can be scheduled after the yoga class to maximize their time without additional conflicts.
   - Planting flowers and cleaning the kitchen cannot be scheduled as they conflict with the priority event and inclusive of the yoga class duration.

5. **Final Schedule**:
   - This schedule ensures that the highest weighted event is included and does not conflict with any other scheduled events.
