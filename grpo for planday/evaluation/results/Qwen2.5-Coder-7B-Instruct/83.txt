Given the events and priority, let's reason through the schedule creation:

1. **List of Events:**
   - Shopping at farmer's market (00:04 - 02:04) [Weight = 2]
   - Cooking pasta (08:47 - 10:02) [Weight = 1]
   - Planting flowers in the garden (20:17 - 21:32) [Weight = 1]
   - Yoga class with Emily (20:32 - 21:02) [Weight = 1]

2. **Constraints:**
   - The shopping event has the highest priority (weight = 2).
   - No overlapping events, and in conflicts, include the event with higher weight.
   - Events must respect their absolute start and end times.

3. **Order of Events:**
   - Since the shopping event is the highest priority and must not overlap, all other events must be placed after it.
   - The cooking pasta event is 11 hours after the shopping, which is far enough to avoid overlaps.
   - The planting flowers and yoga events overlap by 5 minutes (21:02), but since they are both weighted the same (1), the planting flowers event will be placed later to resolve the conflict.

4. **Final Schedule:**
   - Shopping at farmer's market (00:04 - 02:04)
   - Cooking pasta (08:47 - 10:02)
   - Yoga class with Emily (20:32 - 21:02) [This overwrites the 5-minute overlap]
   - Planting flowers in the garden (21:07 - 21:32) [This will be 5 minutes after the yoga class to avoid conflict]

This order ensures that all events respect their absolute times, the priority constraint is respected, and no overlaps occur.
