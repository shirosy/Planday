To optimize the schedule, I need to prioritize and place events based on their start times and weights. Let's break it down:

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)** - Weight = 1
2. **Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)** - Weight = 1
3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)** - Weight = 1
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)** - Weight = 2
5. **Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)** - Weight = 2
6. **Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)** - Weight = 1
7. **Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)** - Weight = 1

### Prioritization Steps:
1. The Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10) and Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18) have the highest priority due to their weight of 2.
2. These two events cannot overlap since they are only 1 hour apart. We should choose the one that fits first and ensures the most weighted minutes are covered.

### Initial Schedule:
1. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)
2. Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)

### Remaining Events:
1. Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)
2. Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)
3. Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)
4. Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)
5. Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)

### Placement of Remaining Events:
- **Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)** and **Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)** both start at 00:51, so only one can fit before the Calculus lecture. Let's place Chess first:
  - Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)
- Now, we can place **Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)**:
  - Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)
- **Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)** and **Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)** can fit after the remaining hours:
  - Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)
  - Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)
