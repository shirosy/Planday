Given the priorities, 'Reading 'Dune'' and 'Cooking pasta', we need to ensure these are included in the schedule.

- 'Reading 'Dune'' can be scheduled during the morning when other events are less likely.
- 'Cooking pasta' should not overlap with other time-sensitive events, so it can be scheduled later.

Let's evaluate the possible schedules:

1. **Morning: Reading 'Dune'**
   - Reading 'Dune' (04:18 - 04:48)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (06:06 - 06:51)

2. **Later in the day: Cooking pasta**
   - Cooking pasta (15:25 - 15:55)
   - Calling Mom and Dad (15:37 - 17:07)
   - Walking with Bella (16:39 - 18:09)
   - Yoga class with Emily (18:26 - 19:26)

3. **Late evening: Jogging at the park and Watching 'Inception'**
   - Jogging at the park (19:55 - 21:55)
   - Watching 'Inception' (21:32 - 22:02)

Taking into account the priorities and ensuring no overlaps, the optimized schedule is:
