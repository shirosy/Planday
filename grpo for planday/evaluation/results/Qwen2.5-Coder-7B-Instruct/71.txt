To create an optimized schedule, I'll first identify the constraints and then place events in chronological order, respecting the priority of "Q1 revenue report writing."

1. "Q1 revenue report writing" starts at 00:37 and ends at 02:07, with a duration of 01:30. This is a priority event.
2. "Marketing standup on Zoom" starts at 00:38 and ends at 02:23, with a duration of 01:45. This is a normal event and does not conflict with "Q1 revenue report writing.\"
3. "One-on-one with manager" starts at 09:43 and ends at 10:58, with a duration of 01:15. This is a priority event.
4. "Replying to emails" starts at 10:42 and ends at 12:12, with a duration of 01:30. This is a normal event and conflicts with "One-on-one with manager," but since "One-on-one with manager" has higher weight, it will be included.
5. "Meeting with Lisa at café" starts at 17:07 and ends at 17:22, with a duration of 00:15. This is a normal event and does not conflict with any other events.

Now, let's arrange the events in a strictly chronological order respects the rules.
