To create an optimized schedule while respecting the given rules and prioritizing events, we need to:

1. Ensure that priority events (Chess with Daniel and Office hours with Prof. Chen) are placed in the earliest feasible time slots without overlapping with other high-priority or normal events.
2. Place normal events (like the Structural Dynamics lecture) in the next available slots that do not interfere with other events.
3. Adjust the study session with Sarah and Mike if necessary to fit within the available time slots without causing overlaps.
4. Examine possible time slots for other normal or low-priority events.
5. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Given events and priorities, let's create a schedule:

- Chess with Daniel (04:51 - 06:36) is a priority (weight = 2), so it defaults to 04:51 - 06:36.
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (14:01 - 15:46) is another priority (weight = 2).

Now, let's slot in other events:

- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (08:20 - 10:05) (weight = 1):
  - It overlaps with the Structural Dynamics lecture (08:39 - 08:54), so we need to reschedule the Structural Dynamics lecture.
- Structural Dynamics lecture (rescheduled to 08:20 - 08:39) (weight = 1):
  - It fits after the Calculus lecture.
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (11:30 - 11:45) (weight = 1):
  - Fits after the research session in the library.
- Quantum computing guest talk (14:01 - 14:16) (weight = 1):
  - Has already been scheduled before office hours.
- Researching in library (19:40 - 19:55) (weight = 1):
  - Fits before the study session.
