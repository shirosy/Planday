First, I will lay out the events in chronological order and then apply the rules to create the optimized schedule.

Chronical Order: 
1. Drone building hackathon (00:08 - 00:53)
2. AI keynote (00:53 - 02:08)
3. Async Python talk (03:50 - 04:35)
4. Web3 panel discussion (06:57 - 08:12)
5. Trying new VR headset (08:24 - 10:24)
6. Live coding on Rust (17:21 - 18:36)
7. Small Language Models talk (19:59 - 20:59)

Given the constraints, we need to ensure:
- The Web3 panel discussion is included.
- No overlaps are allowed.
- The sum of weighted event durations is maximized.

Since the Web3 panel discussion has a higher priority and starts at 06:57, we need to check if it can fit in without causing any conflicts. 

1. Time slot 06:57 - 08:12 is occupied by Web3 panel discussion.
2. The AI keynote and Async Python talk (which start at 00:53 and 03:50 respectively) would conflict with the Web3 panel discussion and thus need to be excluded.
3. Trying new VR headset (08:24 - 10:24) would start immediately after the Web3 panel discussion, and there is room for it.
4. Live coding on Rust (17:21 - 18:36) and Small Language Models talk (19:59 - 20:59) have overlapping time slots with other events and thus need to be excluded.

So, the optimized schedule includes:
- Drone building hackathon (00:08 - 00:53)
- Trying new VR headset (08:24 - 10:24)
- Web3 panel discussion (06:57 - 08:12)
