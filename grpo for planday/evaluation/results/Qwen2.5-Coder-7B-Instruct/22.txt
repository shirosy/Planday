Prioritizing the "Watching 'Inception'" event to ensure it's included as it has the highest weight. The other events cannot be changed or split. 

The Yoga class with Emily and Cooking pasta overlap during the first 15 minutes. Since both have the same weight, we'll keep the higher priority event. In this case, we can choose either, but I'll pick the longer one for variety.

The Deep cleaning the kitchen has a maximum duration of 1 hour, so it doesn't clash with any high-priority events if scheduled properly.

Final schedule:
1. Watching 'Inception' (16:54 - 18:39)
2. Cooking pasta (04:01 - 05:16)
