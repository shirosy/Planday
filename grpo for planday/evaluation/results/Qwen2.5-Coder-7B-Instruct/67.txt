To create the optimized schedule, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify priority events and normal events.
2. Order the events based on their start times.
3. Place priority events in the schedule first if they don't overlap with normal events.
4. Ensure no overlaps by checking the schedule before adding new events.

Events:
- Marketing standup on Zoom (06:24 - 06:39) - weight = 1
- Replying to emails (13:52 - 15:37) - weight = 1
- Preparing PTO handover (14:18 - 15:48) - weight = 2
- Meeting with Lisa at café (16:57 - 18:57) - weight = 1

Priorities:
- Preparing PTO handover

First, I'll place the priority event since it has the highest weight and must not overlap with other events.

- Preparing PTO handover (14:18 - 15:48)

Now I'll place the remaining events, respecting the start times and no overlaps.

- Marketing standup on Zoom (06:24 - 06:39) - no overlap with the PTO handover
- Replying to emails (13:52 - 15:37) - no overlap with the PTO handover
- Meeting with Lisa at café (16:57 - 18:57) - no overlap with the PTO handover
