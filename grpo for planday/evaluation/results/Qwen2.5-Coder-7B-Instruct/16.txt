To create an optimized schedule, I need to prioritize events based on their start times and weights. The marketing standup on Zoom has the highest priority with a weight of 2, so it should come first. Next, I'll place the other events in chronological order, ensuring no overlaps and respecting the given rules.

1. Marketing standup on Zoom (09:38 - 10:53) - Priority event
2. Client call with Acme Corp (14:12 - 15:42)
3. One-on-one with manager (14:13 - 15:43)
4. Preparing PTO handover (19:30 - 21:00)
5. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (01:34 - 03:19)
6. Q1 revenue report writing (01:47 - 02:32)

However, there is a conflict between the Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (01:34 - 03:19) and Q1 revenue report writing (01:47 - 02:32). Since both events have the same weight (1), we need to choose the one that starts earlier. The Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick starts at 01:34, so we'll keep it and exclude the Q1 revenue report writing.
