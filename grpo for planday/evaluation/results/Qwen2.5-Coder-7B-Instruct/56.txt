To create an optimized schedule, I need to ensure that:
1. The events are placed in chronological order.
2. Priority events (weight = 2) are given more weight and respect chronological order.
3. No overlaps are allowed, and higher weighted events take precedence in conflicts.
4. We aim to maximize the sum of weighted event durations.
5. Non-priority events (weight = 1) may be excluded if needed.

Given the events and priorities, let's schedule them step-by-step:

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:08 - 02:23):** This is a priority event (weight = 2).
2. **Brute force all events without worrying about overlaps initially:**
   - Marketing standup: 02:08 - 02:23 (weight = 2)
   - One-on-one with manager: 04:30 - 05:45 (weight = 1)
   - Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick: 07:44 - 09:44 (weight = 2)
   - Analyzing product performance: 11:08 - 13:08 (weight = 1)
   - Preparing PTO handover: 14:20 - 16:20 (weight = 1)
   - Meeting with Lisa at café: 17:44 - 19:14 (weight = 1)
   - Replying to emails: 18:05 - 20:05 (weight = 1)

3. **Identify conflicts where priority events have higher weight and resolve them:**
   - No immediate conflicts were identified in the brute force schedule.

4. **Calculate the sum of weighted event durations:**
   - Marketing standup: 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes of weight
   - Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick: 120 minutes * 2 = 240 minutes of weight
   - Total: 30 + 240 = 270 minutes of weight

    To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we need to include as many events as possible without violating any rules. Let's remove non-priority events one by one to see if we can fit more events in:

5. **Removing non-priority events:**
   - Removing "One-on-one with manager" reduces total weight to 180 minutes.
   - Removing "Analyzing product performance" reduces total weight to 168 minutes.
   - Removing "Preparing PTO handover" reduces total weight to 156 minutes.
   - Removing "Meeting with Lisa at café" reduces total weight to 144 minutes.
   - Removing "Replying to emails" reduces total weight to 132 minutes.

The highest possible sum of weighted event durations is 270 minutes with the following events included:
1. Marketing standup on Zoom (02:08 - 02:23)
2. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (07:44 - 09:44)
