First, let's identify the priority events and other events:

Priority Events:
- Q1 revenue report writing (19:05 - 20:05, weight = 2)
- Preparing PTO handover (14:32 - 15:47, weight = 2)

Other Events:
- Client call with Acme Corp (03:12 - 05:12, weight = 1)
- Analyzing product performance (04:28 - 05:13, weight = 1)
- Meeting with Lisa at café (06:34 - 07:49, weight = 1)

Next, let's try to fit the priority events into the schedule without any overlaps:

1. Start with the earliest priority event: Q1 revenue report writing (19:05 - 20:05)
2. The other priority event, Preparing PTO handover (14:32 - 15:47), conflicts with the first priority event. Since both have the same weight, we need to choose based on the start time. The earlier event starts first.
3. Place the earliest priority event first, from 14:32 to 15:47.
4. Now, place the second priority event, Q1 revenue report writing from 19:05 to 20:05.

The remaining events are:
- Client call with Acme Corp (03:12 - 05:12)
- Analyzing product performance (04:28 - 05:13)
- Meeting with Lisa at café (06:34 - 07:49)

Since these events do not conflict with any priority events, they can be added to the schedule:

1. Client call with Acme Corp from 03:12 to 05:12
2. Analyzing product performance from 04:28 to 05:13
3. Meeting with Lisa at café from 06:34 to 07:49

Now, let's check the total weighted event duration:
- Q1 revenue report writing: 1 hour (2 * 1 hour)
- Preparing PTO handover: 1 hour 15 minutes (2 * 1 hour 15 minutes)
- Client call with Acme Corp: 2 hours 8 minutes (1 * 2 hours 8 minutes)
- Analyzing product performance: 45 minutes (1 * 45 minutes)
- Meeting with Lisa at café: 1 hour 15 minutes (1 * 1 hour 15 minutes)

Total: 5 hours 54 minutes

We have successfully created a schedule that respects the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
