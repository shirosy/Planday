To create an optimized schedule, I need to respect the given rules and maximize the sum of weighted event durations. The main priority is to include the Fireworks event, as it has the highest weighted time. 

First, I'll start by placing the Fireworks event as it is crucial. Then, I'll consider the remaining events and their priorities. The Backstage tour VIP pass and David Guetta DJ set are high-priority events, while the David Bowie tribute concert is a lower-priority event.

Since the Backstage tour VIP pass and David Guetta DJ set overlap with each other, I'll need to choose one, as they cannot both fit in the time slot. The Backstage tour VIP pass has a higher weight of 2 compared to the DJ set, so it should be included.

Finally, I'll include the David Bowie tribute concert, as it has the lowest weight and can fit into the remaining time slot.

Here's the optimized schedule:

<schedule>
  <event>
    <name>Fireworks</name>
    <start>10:30</start>
    <end>11:30</end>
  </event>
  <event>
    <name>Backstage tour VIP pass</name>
    <start>03:05</start>
    <end>03:50</end>
  </event>
  <event>
    <name>David Bowie tribute concert</name>
    <start>15:42</start>
    <end>16:12</end>
  </event>
</schedule>
