To create an optimized schedule, we need to prioritize events based on their weight and ensure that no events overlap. We must respect the given start and end times of each event. The 3D printing workshop (weight = 2) is the highest priority, so it should be scheduled as soon as possible after its start time. Other events will respect the chronological order unless their actual start time is earlier.

Let's start by scheduling the highest priority event first:
1. 3D printing workshop (07:57 - 09:57)

Next, we'll schedule the AI keynote, as it comes immediately after the 3D printing workshop (00:12 - 01:57).

Since the digital detox meditation session is tomorrow (01:01 - 02:01), we can include it without conflict.

For now, we'll skip the Live coding on Rust (02:58 - 03:58), Trying new VR headset (05:51 - 07:36), Small Language Models talk (21:50 - 22:05), Web3 panel discussion (19:20 - 20:05), and Drone building hackathon (19:46 - 21:16) as they all overlap with other events.

The final schedule should respect the chronological order and include all events with the highest priority.
