Let's start by placing the highest priority event, "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" (11:20 - 12:05), since it cannot be moved. This event will consume its entire slot from 11:20 to 12:05.

Next, we need to schedule the other events, respecting the priority of "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" and ensuring no overlaps.

1. **Preparing PTO handover (00:27 - 01:27)**
   - This event fits within the first hour, well before the priority event starts.

2. **Client call with Acme Corp (08:18 - 08:48)**
   - This event can be scheduled right after the priority event ends at 12:05.

3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (04:14 - 05:29)**
   - This event can be placed around the priority event time if needed, but since it overlaps, we'll try to fit it earlier or later. If placed earlier, it might conflict. So, it's better to place it after the priority event or later in the day.

4. **Q1 revenue report writing (11:38 - 12:38)**
   - Conflict with "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" (11:20 - 12:05). Since "Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick" has higher priority, this event must be excluded.

5. **Analyzing product performance (16:27 - 16:57)**
   - This event can be placed after the priority event, right before the one-on-one with the manager.

6. **One-on-one with manager (16:39 - 17:39)**
   - This event can be placed right after the previous event.

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations:
- Calculating weighted durations:
  - Preparing PTO handover: 10 minutes, weight 1 → 10
  - Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick: 45 minutes, weight 2 → 90
  - Client call with Acme Corp: 30 minutes, weight 1 → 30
  - Marketing standup on Zoom: 1 hour 15 minutes, weight 1 → 105
  - Analyzing product performance: 30 minutes, weight 1 → 30
  - One-on-one with manager: 60 minutes, weight 1 → 60

Sum of weighted durations: 10 + 90 + 30 + 105 + 30 + 60 = 225
