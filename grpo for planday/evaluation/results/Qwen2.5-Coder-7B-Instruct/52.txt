I need to create an optimized schedule that respects the chronological order and prioritizes the given events based on their start and end times. The goal is to maximize the sum of weighted event durations, with priority events having a higher weight. The event "Shopping at farmer's market" has a priority weight of 2.

Given events:
1. Planting flowers in the garden (03:11 - 03:26)
2. Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)
3. Cooking pasta (04:34 - 05:04)
4. Walking with Bella (14:14 - 14:59)
5. Yoga class with Emily (17:58 - 18:43)
6. Shopping at farmer's market (21:05 - 21:35)

Step 1: Identify the critical timeline that needs to be respected by all events.
- Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19) spans from 03:34 to 05:19.
- Cooking pasta (04:34 - 05:04) overlaps with Jogging at the park (04:34 - 05:04), so they must not overlap.

Step 2: Allocate the priority event (Shopping at farmer's market) at its designated time.
- This event starts at 21:05 and ends at 21:35. It has the highest priority.

Step 3: Integrate other events around the priority event while ensuring no overlaps.

Final Schedule:
1. Planting flowers in the garden (03:11 - 03:26)
2. Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19)
3. Cooking pasta (04:34 - 05:04)
4. Walking with Bella (14:14 - 14:59)
5. Yoga class with Emily (17:58 - 18:43)
6. Shopping at farmer's market (21:05 - 21:35)

This schedule respects the chronological order, prioritizes the shopping event, and does not overlap any other events.
