First, let's organize the events based on their starting times and weights:

1. One-on-one with manager (00:37 - 02:07) - weight = 1
2. Preparing PTO handover (01:20 - 03:20) - weight = 2, priority
3. Marketing standup on Zoom (03:27 - 03:42) - weight = 1
4. Q1 revenue report writing (04:41 - 05:26) - weight = 1
5. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:58 - 18:28) - weight = 1
6. Analyzing product performance (21:05 - 21:50) - weight = 2, priority

Next, we need to create a schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the rules.

1. Start with the priority events:
   - Preparing PTO handover (01:20 - 03:20) - weight = 2
   - Analyzing product performance (21:05 - 21:50) - weight = 2

   Total weighted time so far: (3:20 - 1:20) + (21:50 - 21:05) = 2:00 + 0:45 = 2:45

2. Now, fit in the non-priority events without overlapping the prioritized events:
   - One-on-one with manager (00:37 - 02:07) - weight = 1. This overlaps with Preparing PTO handover, so exclude it.
   - Marketing standup on Zoom (03:27 - 03:42) - weight = 1, fits after Preparing PTO handover
   - Q1 revenue report writing (04:41 - 05:26) - weight = 1, fits after Marketing standup
   - Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:58 - 18:28) - weight = 1, fits after Analyzing product performance

   Total weighted time so far: 2:45 + 0:15 + 0:45 + 0:45 + 0:30 = 3:60

The final schedule has a total weighted time of 3 hours, which is the maximum possible without violating the rules.
