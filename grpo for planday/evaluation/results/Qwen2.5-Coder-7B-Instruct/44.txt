1. The chess event with Daniel is prioritized and starts at 03:38.
2. The Structural Dynamics lecture starts at 13:30 and must be included.
3. The Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams takes place at 01:40, which conflicts with the chess event. The Chess event must precede the Calculus lecture.
4. The Study session with Sarah and Mike starts at 10:12. This conflicts with both the Chess and Structural Dynamics lectures. It must be scheduled last to maximize its duration.
5. The Meeting with Emma and Jake takes place during the Study session window (10:18 - 11:18), and since it has a lower priority, it should be excluded to respect the Study session.

Given these constraints, the optimized schedule is as follows:
