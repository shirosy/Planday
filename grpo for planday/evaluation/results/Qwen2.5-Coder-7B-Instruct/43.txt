To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given rules, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their durations:
   - Live coding on Rust: 1 hour (start: 11:23, end: 12:23)
   - Web3 panel discussion: 2 hours (start: 06:08, end: 08:08)

2. Place the priority events in chronological order, respecting their start and end times:
   - Web3 panel discussion (06:08 - 08:08)
   - Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23)

3. Check for any conflicts. In conflicts, include the event with the higher weighted time. However, since both priority events have the same weight, we can place them as is.

4. Calculate the total weighted duration:
   - Web3 panel discussion: 2 hours * 2 (weight) = 4
   - Live coding on Rust: 1 hour * 2 (weight) = 2
   - Total weighted duration: 4 + 2 = 6

5. Schedule the remaining events. Since there are no constraints given for these events, we can place them after the priority events, ensuring no overlaps and respecting their start and end times:
   - Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14): This fits between the Web3 panel discussion and the Live coding on Rust.
   - Async Python talk (20:18 - 22:18)
   - Small Language Models talk (20:35 - 22:35): This fits between the Async Python talk and ending at the desired time.
