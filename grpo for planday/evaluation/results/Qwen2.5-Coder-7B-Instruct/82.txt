First, let's organize the events based on their start and end times, and then consider the priorities.

Events with their durations:
1. AI keynote (03:20 - 05:20) - 2 hours
2. Async Python talk (10:33 - 11:33) - 1 hour
3. Small Language Models talk (10:43 - 12:43) - 2 hours
4. Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41) - 1 hour
5. 3D printing workshop (16:57 - 18:27) - 1 hour 30 minutes
6. Live coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20) - 30 minutes
7. Drone building hackathon (19:32 - 21:17) - 1 hour 45 minutes
8. Trying new VR headset (21:23 - 21:38) - 15 minutes

Priorities:
1. Drone building hackathon (weight = 2)
2. AI keynote (weight = 2)

Given the rules, the AI keynote should be scheduled first because it has the highest priority and is in the morning. The Drone building hackathon has the second highest priority and should be scheduled last because it overlaps with the 3D printing workshop and ends early enough to allow for a short VR headset session.

Let's create the schedule:

1. AI keynote (03:20 - 05:20) - Weight = 2
2. Async Python talk (10:33 - 11:33) - Weight = 1
3. Small Language Models talk (10:43 - 12:43) - Weight = 1
4. Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41) - Weight = 1
5. 3D printing workshop (16:57 - 18:27) - Weight = 1
6. Live coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20) - Weight = 1
7. Trying new VR headset (21:23 - 21:38) - Weight = 1
8. Drone building hackathon (19:32 - 21:17) - Weight = 2

This schedule respects the rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations. There are no overlaps and the highest priority events are scheduled first.
