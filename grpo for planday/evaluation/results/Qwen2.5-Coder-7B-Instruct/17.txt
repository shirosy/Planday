To create an optimized schedule, I need to ensure that the events are ordered chronologically and that any conflicts are resolved with priority events. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the chronological order of events**:
   - One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45)
   - Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42)
   - Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37)
   - Preparing PTO handover (20:32 - 20:47)

2. **Identify conflicts and resolve with priority events**:
   - The client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37) has a higher priority than preparing PTO handover (20:32 - 20:47).
   - Therefore, the preparing PTO handover must be excluded to avoid a conflict.

3. **Maximize the sum of weighted event durations**:
   - The priority event is the client call with Acme Corp, which has a weight of 2.
   - The one-on-one with the manager and the meeting with Lisa at the café both have a weight of 1.

4. **Create the final schedule**:
   - One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45) - weight = 1
   - Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42) - weight = 1
   - Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37) - weight = 2

The excluded event is not considered in the final schedule.
