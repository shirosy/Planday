To optimize the schedule while respecting the rules, I need to ensure that the priority event (3D printing workshop) is placed at its earliest possible start time without overlapping with other events. Let's analyze the events and their constraints:

1. **3D printing workshop** (04:39 - 05:09) - Priority
2. **Drone building hackathon** (05:50 - 07:20)
3. **Live coding on Rust** (20:36 - 21:21)
4. **Digital detox meditation session** (20:52 - 21:37)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Place the 3D printing workshop at 04:39 - 05:09**: This is its earliest possible start time and does not overlap with any other event.
2. **Next event after workshops**: The **Drone building hackathon** starts at 05:50.
3. **Conflict with drone building hackathon**: The live coding session and the meditation session both start after 07:20. Placing the coding session at 20:36 respects the non-overlap rule.
4. **Place the live coding session at 20:36 - 21:21**: This does not overlap with the meditation session.
5. **Place the meditation session at 20:52 - 21:37**: This respects the non-overlap rule.

Thus, the optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations is:
