The key is to place the priority event (AI keynote) at its time slot and then schedule the other events around it, ensuring no overlaps and maximizing weighted durations.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. AI keynote is at 10:47 - 11:47 (weight = 2).
2. The Async Python talk follows at 08:21 - 09:21 (weight = 1).
3. The Web3 panel discussion is at 11:45 - 12:15 (weight = 1).
4. The Drone building hackathon is at 12:26 - 14:11 (weight = 1).

Since the AI keynote is already at its designated time and has the highest priority, we can place the other events around it:
- Async Python talk should be before 10:47.
- Web3 panel discussion should be after 11:45.
- Drone building hackathon cannot conflict with any other events but must complete before the next appropriate time slot.

The final schedule looks like this:

- Async Python talk: 08:21 - 09:21
- Web3 panel discussion: 11:45 - 12:15
- AI keynote: 10:47 - 11:47
- Drone building hackathon: 12:26 - 14:11
