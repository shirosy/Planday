First, I need to arrange the events in chronological order:
1. Group study for physics test (05:08 - 05:23)
2. Quantum computing guest talk (06:57 - 07:27)
3. Structural Dynamics lecture (12:31 - 14:31)
4. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (13:08 - 13:53)
5. Researching in library (14:35 - 16:20)
6. Chemistry experiment (20:30 - 22:15)

Next, I'll consider the priority event, which is the Group study for physics test (weight = 2). It is already scheduled and should not be moved earlier.

Now, I will focus on maximizing the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping. Let's check the opportunities:

- The Group study for physics test starts at 05:08 and ends at 05:23.
- The Quantum computing guest talk starts at 06:57 and ends at 07:27. It does not overlap with the Group study time.
- The Structural Dynamics lecture starts at 12:31 and ends at 14:31. It does not overlap with the Group study time.
- The Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams starts at 13:08 and ends at 13:53. It does not overlap with the Group study time.
- The Researching in library starts at 14:35 and ends at 16:20, and it does not overlap with the Group study time.
- The Chemistry experiment starts at 20:30 and ends at 22:15, and it does not overlap with any other events.

Since all events are either not overlapping or starting on the same time as the Group study, they can all be included without any need for adjustment. Therefore, the schedule remains unchanged.

The total weighted duration is:
- Group study for physics test (2 x 15 minutes) = 30 minutes
- Quantum computing guest talk (1 x 30 minutes) = 30 minutes
- Structural Dynamics lecture (1 x 120 minutes) = 120 minutes
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (1 x 45 minutes) = 45 minutes
- Researching in library (1 x 145 minutes) = 145 minutes
- Chemistry experiment (1 x 85 minutes) = 85 minutes

Total: 30 + 30 + 120 + 45 + 145 + 85 = 445 minutes
