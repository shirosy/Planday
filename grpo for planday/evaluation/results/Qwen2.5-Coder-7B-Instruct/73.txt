Let's first list out the events and their priorities:

1. Live coding on Rust (00:59 - 02:59)
2. Small Language Models talk (07:32 - 08:32)
3. Web3 panel discussion (08:16 - 09:46)
4. Trying new VR headset (08:56 - 09:41)
5. AI keynote (10:36 - 12:06)
6. Async Python talk (14:00 - 14:15)
7. 3D printing workshop (16:43 - 18:43)

Priorities:
1. 3D printing workshop
2. Trying new VR headset

We need to ensure that both the 3D printing workshop and Trying new VR headset are included in the schedule if possible, without causing any overlaps. 

First, let's see if these two events can fit together:
- 3D printing workshop (16:43 - 18:43) has more weight than Trying new VR headset (08:56 - 09:41).

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should try to include these prioritized events first:

1. 3D printing workshop (16:43 - 18:43) - priority 2
2. Trying new VR headset (08:56 - 09:41) - priority 2

Now let's see if we can fit the other events around these prioritized events:

- Live coding on Rust (00:59 - 02:59) can be scheduled first (weight 1).
- Small Language Models talk (07:32 - 08:32) can follow (weight 1).
- Web3 panel discussion (08:16 - 09:46) conflicts with Trying new VR headset, so it cannot be included.
- AI keynote (10:36 - 12:06) can be scheduled after the 3D printing workshop (weight 1).
- Async Python talk (14:00 - 14:15) can be scheduled after the 3D printing workshop (weight 1).

Let's place the events in order:

1. Live coding on Rust (00:59 - 02:59)
2. Small Language Models talk (07:32 - 08:32)
3. 3D printing workshop (16:43 - 18:43)
4. Trying new VR headset (08:56 - 09:41)
5. AI keynote (10:36 - 12:06)
6. Async Python talk (14:00 - 14:15)

We need to move Trying new VR headset to a time that avoids conflict with Web3 panel discussion and the 3D printing workshop. Since the Web3 panel discussion conflicts with Trying new VR headset, we need to schedule it earlier, which is already covered by the Live coding on Rust and Small Language Models talk.
