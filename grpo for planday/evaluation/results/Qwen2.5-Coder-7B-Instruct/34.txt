To create an optimized schedule, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the priorities and their weights.
2. Arrange events in chronological order.
3. Ensure no conflicts by assigning priority events higher weights.
4. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting chronological order and no overlaps.

Given events:
- Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19) [Weight = 2 (Priority)]
- Deep cleaning the kitchen (03:39 - 05:39) [Weight = 1]
- Cooking pasta (12:06 - 12:21) [Weight = 1]
- Shopping at farmer's market (15:55 - 17:40) [Weight = 1]

1. Priority event: Jogging at the park from 03:34 to 05:19.
2. Remaining events in chronological order:
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen from 03:39 to 05:39
   - Cooking pasta from 12:06 to 12:21
   - Shopping at farmer's market from 15:55 to 17:40

3. Arrange without overlapping, giving priority to the Jogging at the park:
   - Start with Jogging at the park from 03:34 - 05:19
   - The deep cleaning overlaps with Jogging, so skip it
   - Next is Cooking pasta from 12:06 - 12:21
   - Finally, Shopping at the farmer's market from 15:55 - 17:40

4. Check no overlaps and ensure chronological order is maintained.
5. Verify the sum of weighted event durations:
   - Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19) = 1 hour 45 minutes (1.75 hours * 2) = 3.5 hours
   - Cooking pasta (12:06 - 12:21) = 15 minutes (0.25 hours * 1) = 0.25 hours
   - Shopping at the farmer's market (15:55 - 17:40) = 1 hour 45 minutes (1.75 hours * 1) = 1.75 hours

Total weighted duration: 3.5 + 0.25 + 1.75 = 5.5 hours
