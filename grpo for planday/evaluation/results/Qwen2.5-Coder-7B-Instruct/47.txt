The priorities are clear: the Marketing standup on Zoom should be included in the schedule as it has the highest weight (2). All other events have a weight of 1.

Let's arrange the events in chronological order, respecting the rules:

1. Analyzing product performance (01:11 - 01:56)
2. Client call with Acme Corp (06:34 - 07:19)
3. Marketing standup on Zoom (14:51 - 15:51)
4. Q1 revenue report writing (15:19 - 16:04)

The Marketing standup on Zoom overlaps with the Q1 revenue report writing event (15:19 - 16:04). Since the Marketing standup has a higher priority, we need to exclude the Q1 revenue report writing event to respect the rules.
