The first step is to identify and list the events based on their weights and times. We have two distinct weight levels: normal events (weight = 1) and priority events (weight = 2). 

Normal events:
1. Structural Dynamics lecture (00:34 - 01:19)
2. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:20 - 03:20)
3. Chemistry experiment (08:12 - 09:57)
4. Chess with Daniel (19:03 - 21:03)

Priority event:
1. Meeting with Emma and Jake (09:54 - 10:09)

Next, I'll arrange the events chronologically and prioritize the meeting with Emma and Jake.

1. Structural Dynamics lecture (00:34 - 01:19)
2. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:20 - 03:20)
3. Chemistry experiment (08:12 - 09:57)
4. Meeting with Emma and Jake (09:54 - 10:09)
5. Chess with Daniel (19:03 - 21:03)
6. Group study for physics test (19:41 - 21:26)

Now, I need to check for any conflicts or overlaps. In this case, there are no time conflicts. The meeting with Emma and Jake (priority event) is placed after the chemistry experiment and before the chess session. Since the meeting carries higher weight, other events have been placed around it to ensure no conflicts while maximizing the total weighted event duration.

Finally, I'll double-check the schedule to ensure it respects all rules and constraints.
