First, let's analyze the events and their constraints:
1. Cooking pasta: 02:12 - 02:27 (15 minutes)
2. Shopping at farmer's market: 02:23 - 02:38 (15 minutes)
3. Calling Mom and Dad: 06:02 - 08:02 (2 hours)
4. Deep cleaning the kitchen: 15:40 - 16:40 (60 minutes)
5. Watching 'Inception': 20:37 - 22:07 (80 minutes)

We need to incorporate the priority event "Deep cleaning the kitchen" and maximize the sum of weighted event durations up to 200 minutes.

Given the events span from 02:12 to 22:07, let's see if we can fit everything within this timeframe.

1. **Deep cleaning the kitchen** (priority) starts at 15:40 and ends at 16:40. This spans 2 hours, so it will consume the whole evening.
2. **Watching 'Inception'** can fit in after deep cleaning as it starts at 20:37 and ends at 22:07.

Now, let's fill the remaining morning time:
- **Shopping at farmer's market** starts at 02:23 and ends at 02:38.
- **Cooking pasta** starts at 02:12 and ends at 02:27, overlapping with the shopping event, but we need to find a way to fit it in later.

If we exclude the overlapping time, we can squeeze in:
- **Cooking pasta** at an earlier time before priorities.

Given that "Deep Cleaning" spans the whole evening and "Inception" is already scheduled, we should focus on optimizing the morning.

Let's create a schedule that aligns with these constraints:
