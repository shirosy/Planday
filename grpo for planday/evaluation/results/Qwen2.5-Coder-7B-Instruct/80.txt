To create an optimized schedule, I need to consider the following:

1. **Chronological Order**: All events must be placed in their exact start and end times.
2. **Priority Events**: The meeting with Lisa at the café is a priority event and should be scheduled as soon as possible.
3. **Maximize Weighted Event Durations**: Both priority and normal events need to be included in a way that maximizes their sum of weighted durations without causing overlaps.

Let's break down the events and find the best way to fit them into the schedule.

### Step-by-Step Schedule Construction:

1. **Meeting with Lisa at Café (02:41 - 04:11)**: This is a priority event, so it should be placed at the beginning of the day.
2. **Marketing standup on Zoom (04:59 - 06:14)**: This event starts after the priority event, respecting the chronological order.
3. **One-on-one with manager (09:15 - 10:30)**: This event starts after other events, following the chronological order.
4. **Client call with Acme Corp (16:21 - 17:21)**: This event starts after other events, respecting the chronological order.
5. **Preparing PTO handover (19:34 - 21:19)**: This event starts after other events, following the chronological order.
6. **Q1 revenue report writing (02:41 - 04:14)**: This event is from midnight to 4:14 AM, which means it overlaps with the priority event. **Note**: I cannot split or adjust event times, so I'll exclude this event to respect the strict rules.

### Balanced Schedule:

By following these steps, here is the final optimized schedule:
