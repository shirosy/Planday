First, let's analyze the events and their constraints:

1. **Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)**: Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes
2. **Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)**: Duration = 1 hour 45 minutes
3. **Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45)**: Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)**: Duration = 1 hour 30 minutes

Priorities:
- **Study session with Sarah and Mike (weight = 2)**

Constraints:
- **Maximize the sum of weighted event durations**
- **No overlaps allowed**
- **Ensure high-priority events (weight = 2) are included first if possible**

Given these constraints, let's start the schedule with the study session since it has the highest priority.

1. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)**: Duration = 1 hour 30 minutes (weight = 2)
2. **Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)**: Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes (weight = 1)
3. **Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)**: Duration = 1 hour 45 minutes (weight = 1)
4. **Chess with Daniel (18:30 - 19:45)**: Duration = 1 hour 15 minutes (weight = 1)

Now, let's verify if this schedule meets all the rules:
- The study session is included first as it has the highest priority.
- No events overlap.
- All time slots are respected.

The total weighted duration of the schedule:
- Study session (2 * 1 hour 30 minutes) = 2 hours 30 minutes
- Structural Dynamics lecture (1 * 1 hour 15 minutes) = 1 hour 15 minutes
- Researching in library (1 * 1 hour 45 minutes) = 1 hour 45 minutes
- Chess with Daniel (1 * 1 hour 15 minutes) = 1 hour 15 minutes

Sum of weighted durations = 2 hours 30 minutes + 1 hour 15 minutes + 1 hour 45 minutes + 1 hour 15 minutes = 6 hours.

Thus, the optimized schedule is:
