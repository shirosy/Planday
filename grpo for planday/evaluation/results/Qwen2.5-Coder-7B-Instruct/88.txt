To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify priority and normal events based on their weights.
2. Determine the correct order of events based on their start times.
3. Check for any conflicts between events and ensure no overlaps by preferring higher-weighted events in such cases.
4. Calculate the sum of weighted event durations to ensure optimization.

Given events and priorities:
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (weight 2, 04:55 - 06:55)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (weight 1, 06:30 - 06:45)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (weight 1, 06:56 - 08:26)
- Chess with Daniel (weight 2, 07:43 - 08:13)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight 1, 14:13 - 14:58)

Step 1: Event order based on start times:
1. Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55)
2. Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45)
3. Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26)
4. Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13)
5. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58)

Step 2: Check for conflicts and apply priority rules:
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55) is early and has priority.
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45) overlap with the meeting but Jessica's meeting has priority, so we exclude these.
- Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26) starts immediately after the first event and has normal weight, so it follows.
- Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13) overlaps with the Structural Dynamics lecture but has higher priority, so it takes precedence.
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58) is the last and has normal weight, so it goes last.

Step 3: Verify no overlaps and correct order:
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26)
- Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58)

Step 4: Calculate the sum of weighted event durations:
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (weight 2) = 2 hours
- Chess with Daniel (weight 2) = 1 hour and 13 minutes
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight 1) = 45 minutes
- Total = 2 hours + 1 hour and 13 minutes + 0 hours and 45 minutes = 3 hours and 58 minutes
