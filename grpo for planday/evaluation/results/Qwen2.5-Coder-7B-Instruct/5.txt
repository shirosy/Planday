To create the optimized schedule, I'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The priority event is "Watching 'Inception'" (01:29 - 02:44), which has a weight of 2.

2. **Ensure Priority Events Respect Chronological Order**: As this is a priority event and its start time is 01:29, it must appear in the schedule at that time.

3. **Maximize Weighted Event Duration**: Since the priority event is already included at its optimal time, I'll need to maximize the duration of other events without overlapping.

4. **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure no other events overlap with the priority event and respect the given rules.

5. **Exclude or Adjust Events if Necessary**: If necessary, exclude or adjust other events to meet the constraints.

Based on these steps, the events are already arranged in chronological order and respect the rules provided. The priority event "Watching 'Inception'" is included as specified.
