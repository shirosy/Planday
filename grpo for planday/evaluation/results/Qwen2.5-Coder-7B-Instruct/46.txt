Let's first list all the events with their start and end times:
1. Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00)
2. Trying new VR headset (01:40 - 02:10)
3. Async Python talk (05:30 - 06:45)
4. AI keynote (06:18 - 07:03)
5. Networking with engineers (20:35 - 21:50)

The priority event is the AI keynote (weight = 2).

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should prioritize the AI keynote if possible.

Let's analyze the schedule:
1. Web3 panel discussion lasts 45 minutes. It can be included without overlapping other events.
2. Trying new VR headset starts after the Web3 panel discussion ends. However, it overlaps with the remaining events.
3. Async Python talk has a start time of 05:30, which is after the AI keynote has ended.
4. AI keynote is the priority event and should be included first to maximize weight.
5. Networking with engineers starts too late and is non-essential if it doesn't fit.

Let's build the schedule:

1. AI keynote (06:18 - 07:03) - weight = 2
2. Async Python talk (05:30 - 06:45) - weight = 1
