To create an optimized schedule while respecting the given rules and priorities, let's break down the problem step by step. We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations, ensuring that priority events are given higher importance and non-overlapping.

1. **List all events with their durations and priorities:**
   - Shopping at farmer's market (01:40 - 03:40, weight = 1)
   - Cooking pasta (03:23 - 04:08, weight = 1)
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (06:46 - 08:46, weight = 1)
   - Walking with Bella (08:28 - 09:28, weight = 1)
   - Reading 'Dune' (09:59 - 10:29, weight = 1)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (14:09 - 15:54, weight = 1)
   - Calling Mom and Dad (18:03 - 20:03, weight = 2)

2. **Identify overlapping events:**
   - No events overlap with each other.

3. **Include the priority event:**
   - Since Calling Mom and Dad is a priority event (weight = 2), it should be included in the schedule. However, we need to check if it affects other events.

4. **Consider potential conflicts:**
   - The remaining events have no conflicts with each other, so they can be included in the schedule.

5. **Calculate the total weighted duration:**
   - Sum of weights = 2 (优先) + 1 (不优先) + 1 (不优先) + 1 (不优先) + 1 (不优先) + 1 (不优先) = 5

6. **Construct the schedule:**
   - The schedule should start with the priority event and then include other non-conflicting events in chronological order.
