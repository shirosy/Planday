1. First, I need to ensure that the "Small Language Models talk" event is included in the schedule due to its higher priority.
2. Next, I'll place the other events in chronological order, respecting the given constraints and ensuring no overlaps, and prioritizing events that might overlap with the already scheduled "Small Language Models talk".
3. I'll calculate the total weighted duration of the schedule to ensure it's optimized.
