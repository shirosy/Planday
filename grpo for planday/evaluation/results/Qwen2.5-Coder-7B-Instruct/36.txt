First, I need to identify the fixed and flexible events, ensure no overlaps, and maximize the sum of weighted event durations respecting the given rules.

### Events Summary:
- Structural Dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21)
- Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00, priority)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41, priority)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (11:53 - 12:23)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (12:31 - 12:46)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:30 - 15:00)
- Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21, priority)
- Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34)

### Priorities:
1. Office hours with Prof. Chen (weight = 2)
2. Chess with Daniel (weight = 2)
3. Quantum computing guest talk (weight = 1)

### Potential Schedule:
1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41, weight = 2)**
2. **Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00, weight = 1)**
3. **Structural Dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21)**
4. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (11:53 - 12:23)**
5. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (12:31 - 12:46)**
6. **Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21, weight = 2)**
7. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:30 - 15:00)**
8. **Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34)**

### Verification:
- Priority 1: Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41) - Max inventory of time slots covered.
- Priority 2: Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00) - Avoids overlapping with Office hours.
- Priority 3: Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21) - Conflict with study session, but higher weighted.
- No conflicting events, respecting the weight rule.
