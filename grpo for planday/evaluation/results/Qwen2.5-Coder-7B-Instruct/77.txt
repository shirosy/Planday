To create an optimized schedule, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify priority events and assign them higher weights, but respect their chronological order.
2. Determine the total duration of all events combined.
3. Identify any overlapping events and resolve them according to the weight rules.
4. Adjust the schedule to maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping.

Let's start by listing the events with their weights:

- Live coding on Rust (weight = 1)
- Digital detox meditation session (weight = 1)
- Trying new VR headset (weight = 1)
- Drone building hackathon (weight = 1)
- Small Language Models talk (weight = 1)
- Networking with engineers (weight = 2)
- AI keynote (weight = 2)
- Web3 panel discussion (weight = 1)

Total duration of all events: 00:23 - 01:23 + 00:59 - 01:44 + 02:18 - 03:33 + 04:38 - 06:38 + 11:03 - 11:18 + 11:32 - 13:32 + 11:39 - 13:24 + 18:19 - 19:49
  = 5 hours and 25 minutes

Next, let's handle the scheduling with the priority events first:

1. AI keynote (11:39 - 13:24)
2. Networking with engineers (11:32 - 13:32)

The AI keynote ends at 13:24, and the networking event starts at 11:32 and ends at 13:32. Therefore, these events can be scheduled back-to-back without overlap.

Now, let's add the remaining events:

3. Trying new VR headset (02:18 - 03:33)
4. Drone building hackathon (04:38 - 06:38)
5. Small Language Models talk (11:03 - 11:18)

We already have the AI keynote and networking event, so we need to fit the rest in the available slots:

6. Live coding on Rust (00:23 - 01:23)
7. Digital detox meditation session (00:59 - 01:44)

These two events can be scheduled before the VR headset event. 

Finally, the Web3 panel discussion (18:19 - 19:49) can be scheduled after the networking session.

Here's the optimized schedule:
