1. **List Events and Priorities:**
   - Fireworks: 09:45 - 10:45 (weight = 1)
   - Silent disco party: 09:50 - 11:05 (weight = 1)
   - Korean BBQ food trucks: 12:16 - 13:16 (weight = 1)
   - David Bowie tribute concert: 13:29 - 15:14 (weight = 1)
   - Avril Lavigne concert: 17:25 - 18:25 (weight = 2)

2. **Determine Chronological Order and Potential Conflicts:**
   - Fireworks, Silent disco party, Korean BBQ food trucks, and David Bowie tribute concert can potentially overlap.
   - Avril Lavigne concert has a higher weight and must be included at 17:25 - 18:25.

3. **Exclude Overlapping Events and Adjust Schedule:**
   - The Avril Lavigne concert starts at 17:25 and ends at 18:25, so it cannot overlap with any other events.
   - Silent disco party (09:50 - 11:05) can extend until 12:05 without conflicting with the Korean BBQ food trucks (12:16 - 13:16) or the Avril Lavigne concert.
   - The Korean BBQ food trucks can end at 13:16 without conflicting with the David Bowie tribute concert (13:29 - 15:14).

4. **Optimize Schedule:**
   - Remove the David Bowie tribute concert as it conflicts with multiple events and has a low weight.
   - The schedule now includes Fireworks (09:45 - 10:45), Silent disco party (09:50 - 12:05), Korean BBQ food trucks (12:16 - 13:16), and Avril Lavigne concert (17:25 - 18:25).

5. **Verify Weighted Durations:**
   - Fireworks: 09:45 - 10:45 (60 minutes, weight = 1)
   - Silent disco party: 09:50 - 12:05 (135 minutes, weight = 1)
   - Korean BBQ food trucks: 12:16 - 13:16 (60 minutes, weight = 1)
   - Avril Lavigne concert: 17:25 - 18:25 (60 minutes, weight = 2)
   - Total weighted duration: 60 + 135 + 60 + 60 = 315 minutes
