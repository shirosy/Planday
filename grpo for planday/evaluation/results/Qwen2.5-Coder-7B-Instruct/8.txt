The priority event is "Deep cleaning the kitchen." Since it's high weight (weight = 2) compared to the other events (weight = 1), we should schedule it at its earliest possible time without conflicting with any other events.

Let's evaluate the schedule step by step:
1. "Deep cleaning the kitchen" starts at 02:15 and ends at 03:30. This is clearly at the beginning of the day and doesn't conflict with any other events.
2. After deep cleaning, we have a gap from 03:30 to 04:20. This time slot is longer than the duration of "Watching 'Inception'" and can fit either "Watchin 'Inception'" or directly schedule "Yoga class with Emily."
3. However, "Yoga class with Emily" is priority events and must be placed after all lower weight events. So, we place "Yoga class with Emily" starting at 04:20 and ending at 06:20, filling up this entire slot.
4. The remaining time from 06:20 to 07:30 can be filled with "Calling Mom and Dad."
5. Finally, at 20:07, "Walking with Bella" is placed without any conflict with the previous events.

Therefore, the optimized schedule is as follows:

<schedule>
<event>
<name>Deep cleaning the kitchen</name>
<start>02:15</start>
<end>03:30</end>
