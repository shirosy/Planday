1. Identify all events and their priorities.
2. Determine the strict chronological order by respecting the start and end times.
3. Prioritize events that start earlier, regardless of their weight.
4. If conflicts arise, place the higher weighted event.
5. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations without overlapping any events.

### Chronological Order
1. One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32)
2. Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07)
3. Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13) - Priority event
4. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:06 - 17:51)
5. Replying to emails (18:55 - 19:10)
6. Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30)
7. Meeting with Lisa at café (19:58 - 21:58)

### Scheduled Events
1. One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32) - weight = 1
2. Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07) - weight = 1
3. Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13) - weight = 2
4. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:06 - 17:51) - weight = 1
5. Replying to emails (18:55 - 19:10) - weight = 1
6. Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30) - weight = 1
7. Meeting with Lisa at café (19:58 - 21:58) - weight = 1

### Sum of Weighted Event Durations
- Marketing standup on Zoom: 2 * (12:13 - 11:43) = 2 * 30 minutes = 60 minutes
- One-on-one with manager: 1 * 15 minutes = 15 minutes
- Preparing PTO handover: 1 * 30 minutes = 30 minutes
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick: 1 * 45 minutes = 45 minutes
- Replying to emails: 1 * 15 minutes = 15 minutes
- Client call with Acme Corp: 1 * 60 minutes = 60 minutes
- Meeting with Lisa at café: 1 * 2 hours = 120 minutes

Total: 60 + 15 + 30 + 45 + 15 + 60 + 120 = 360 minutes = 6 hours
