The goal is to optimize the schedule to maximize the sum of weighted event durations, given the constraints. The AI keynote has a higher priority (weight = 2) compared to the other events (weight = 1). Here's the initial schedule without considering optimization:

<schedule>
<event>
<name>Digital detox meditation session</name>
<start>02:53</start>
<end>04:08</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Drone building hackathon</name>
<start>03:52</start>
<end>05:52</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>AI keynote</name>
<start>11:20</start>
<end>12:05</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Networking with engineers</name>
<start>13:31</start>
<end>14:46</end>
</event>
</schedule>

Since the AI keynote has a higher priority and must respect its chronological order, it will not affect the earlier events. However, the Drone building hackathon overlaps with the AI keynote. To maximize the weighted duration, we exclude the Drone building hackathon as it has a lower weight.

The AI keynote and the networking event can be scheduled without overlapping, as follows:

<schedule>
<event>
<name>Digital detox meditation session</name>
<start>02:53</start>
<end>04:08</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>AI keynote</name>
<start>11:20</start>
<end>12:05</end>
</event>
<event>
<name>Networking with engineers</name>
<start>13:31</start>
<end>14:46</end>
</event>
</schedule>

This schedule meets all the constraints and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.
