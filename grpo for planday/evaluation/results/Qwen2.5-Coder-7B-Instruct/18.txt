To create an optimized schedule, we need to place the priority event, "Analyzing product performance," first since it has the highest weight. Then, we will place the one-on-one with the manager, which has a slightly higher weight than a normal event. After that, we will place the other events in chronological order while respecting the non-overlapping rule.

1. Analyzing product performance (13:41 - 14:41)
2. One-on-one with manager (02:30 - 04:15)
3. Meeting with Lisa at café (12:29 - 14:14)
4. Preparing PTO handover (18:46 - 20:01)
5. Replying to emails (04:03 - 04:48)

We need to check if any events overlap and adjust if necessary. In this case, the one-on-one with the manager starts before "Analyzing product performance" and ends shortly after it, so it needs to be placed earlier. We also need to ensure that the meeting with Lisa and the preparing PTO handover do not overlap with any other events.

After adjusting the schedule, we get:

1. One-on-one with manager (02:30 - 04:15)
2. Meeting with Lisa at café (12:29 - 14:14)
3. Preparing PTO handover (18:46 - 20:01)
4. Analyzing product performance (13:41 - 14:41)
5. Replying to emails (04:03 - 04:48)
