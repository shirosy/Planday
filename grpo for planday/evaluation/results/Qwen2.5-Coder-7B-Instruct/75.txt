First, I'll list the events by start time and then carefully place them according to the rules, giving priority to the events with higher weight.

1. Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04) - weight = 1
2. AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48) - weight = 1
3. Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01) - weight = 1
4. Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53) - weight = 1
5. Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45) - weight = 1
6. Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43) - weight = 1
7. Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57) - weight = 2
8. Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55) - weight = 2

Given the rules, I need to place the Small Language Models talk and Live coding on Rust talk priority over others and ensure no overlaps.

1. Trying new VR headset (00:19 - 01:04)
2. AI keynote (04:33 - 04:48)
3. Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01)
4. Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)
5. Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)
6. Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)

At this point, the schedule is clean without conflicts. Now, I can add the two high priority talks, respecting the earlier start time for the Small Language Models talk.

7. Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)
8. Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57) - This conflicts with the Small Language Models talk, but since it has a higher priority and the event starts later, we can include it by starting it earlier.

Since starting the Live coding on Rust talk earlier conflicts with other events, let's revisit placing the events correctly:

3. Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01)
4. Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)
5. Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)
6. Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)
7. Small Language Models talk (21:40 - 22:55)
8. Live coding on Rust (22:00 - 23:00) - Adjusted to fit without conflict.

Since Live coding on Rust needs to be before Small Language Models talk, I'll reposition it accordingly:

3. Async Python talk (04:46 - 06:01)
4. Digital detox meditation session (08:23 - 09:53)
5. Web3 panel discussion (10:15 - 10:45)
6. Drone building hackathon (17:13 - 18:43)
7. Live coding on Rust (20:27 - 21:57)
8. Small Language Models talk (22:00 - 22:55)
