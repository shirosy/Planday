To create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given constraints, I will follow these steps:

1. **Sort Events Chronologically:** First, I need to list the events in the order they are to take place.

2. **Identify Priority Events:** The priority events are "Marketing standup on Zoom" and "Analyzing product performance," both with a weight of 2.

3. **Check for Overlaps:** Ensure that priority events do not overlap with each other and with any other events. If they do, exclude the lower-priority event.

4. **Maximize Weighted Durations:** aim to include as many events as possible, prioritizing those whose start times are earlier.

5. **Adjust for Weight and Duration:** Since the product performance analysis is longer and starts earlier, it should be given priority over the website content update.

With these considerations, I will draft the schedule:

- **02:40 - 04:40: Meeting with Lisa at café**
- **04:47 - 05:17: Client call with Acme Corp**
- **12:12 - 13:42: Analyzing product performance** (Weight 2)
- **13:51 - 20:00: (Excluded) Preparing PTO handover** (Overlaps with Marketing standup and Weight 1 event)
- **20:36 - 21:06: Marketing standup on Zoom** (Weight 2)
- **15:29 - 15:44: Updating website content** (Not included, had to be adjusted to end earlier due to conflict)

This schedule respects the priority of the events, avoids overlaps, and maximizes the weighted event duration.
