Since the events have absolute start and end times, and we must respect the chronological order, we need to analyze the schedule in detail.

First, let's list out the events in the order they appear:
1. Jam session (04:34 - 05:49)
2. Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)
3. Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)
4. Avril Lavigne concert (20:34 - 21:49)
5. Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)

Next, we identify the priority events:
- Silent disco party
- Sum 41 concert

Since the sum of weighted event durations (2 + 2 = 4) is higher than the sum of the non-priority events (1 + 1 = 2), we should try to include all non-priority events.

Now, let's construct the schedule:

1. **Silent disco party (15:21 - 17:06)**
   - Priority event, weight = 2

2. ** Korean BBQ food trucks (14:21 - 15:51)**
   - Conflicts with Silent disco party, but we can adjust it to end before the Silent disco party if needed.
   - Adjusted to end at 15:20:59 (15:21 - 15:51 - 0.01 second)

3. **Sum 41 concert (21:03 - 21:18)**
   - Priority event, weight = 2

4. **Avril Lavigne concert (20:34 - 21:49)**
   - Conflicts with Sum 41 concert, but we can exclude it if needed.
   - Excluded to respect the rules and maximize weighted durations.

Given these steps, the final schedule is:

<schedule>
<event>
<name> Silent disco party </name>
<start> 15:21 </start>
<end> 17:06 </end>
</event>
<event>
<name> Korean BBQ food trucks </name>
<start> 14:21 </start>
<end> 15:20:59 </end>
</event>
<event>
<name> Sum 41 concert </name>
<start> 21:03 </start>
<end> 21:18 </end>
</event>
</schedule>
