To create the optimized schedule, I need to follow the rules and prioritize the events based on their weights and conflicts. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all events with their start and end times.**
2. **Prioritize events based on their weights (normal events weight = 1, priority events weight = 2).**
3. **Resolve conflicts by favoring higher weighted events.**
4. **Ensure no overlaps and respect chronological order.**

Given the events and their start and end times, let's prioritize and schedule them:

- **Cooking pasta** (07:18 - 07:33) weight = 2
- Watching 'Inception' (01:27 - 02:57) weight = 1
- Planting flowers in the garden (11:25 - 12:40) weight = 1
- Shopping at farmer's market (12:53 - 14:08) weight = 1
- Reading 'Dune' (13:02 - 13:17) weight = 1
- Walking with Bella (13:19 - 15:04) weight = 1
- Jogging at the park (16:54 - 17:09) weight = 1
- Yoga class with Emily (15:45 - 17:15) weight = 1

### Step-by-Step Scheduling

1. **Cooking pasta** (07:18 - 07:33) is the priority event.
   - Place it first in the schedule.

2. **Watching 'Inception' (01:27 - 02:57)** starts before the cooking time, so it must be scheduled before cooking pasta.
   - Place it next in the schedule.

3. **Planting flowers in the garden (11:25 - 12:40)** starts after cooking pasta and ends before walking with Bella, so it can be placed after cooking pasta.
   - Place it after cooking pasta.

4. **Shopping at farmer's market (12:53 - 14:08)** overlaps with planting flowers, so it must be scheduled after planting flowers.
   - Place it after planting flowers.

5. **Reading 'Dune' (13:02 - 13:17)** overlaps with shopping, so it must be scheduled after shopping.
   - Place it after shopping.

6. **Walking with Bella (13:19 - 15:04)** overlaps with reading 'Dune' and ends before jogging.
   - Place it after reading 'Dune'.

7. **Jogging at the park (16:54 - 17:09)** overlaps with walking with Bella, so it must be scheduled after walking with Bella and ends before the yoga class.
   - Place it before >= 17:09 (since walking with Bella ends at 15:04).

8. **Yoga class with Emily (15:45 - 17:15)** overlaps with jogging and should be placed before jogging ends, but it can be scheduled immediately after jogging stops.
