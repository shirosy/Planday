1. Let's first list out the events and their priorities:
   - Event 1: Drone building hackathon (10:02 - 10:47) (weight = 1)
   - Event 2: Web3 panel discussion (16:03 - 16:33) (weight = 1)
   - Event 3: Live coding on Rust (17:22 - 18:52) (weight = 1)
   - Event 4: Networking with engineers (19:56 - 21:56) (weight = 2)
   - Event 5: Trying new VR headset (21:29 - 22:44) (weight = 2)

2. We need to maximize the sum of weighted event durations. The total duration for Events 4 and 5 combined is 108 minutes, which is the highest possible sum given the weights and without any conflicts.

3. Now, let's place the events:
   - Event 1: 10:02 - 10:47
   - Event 2: 16:03 - 16:33
   - Event 3: 17:22 - 18:52

4. After placing the above events, we have 11 minutes (18:52 - 19:03) free between 18:52 and 19:03 to potentially fit Event 4 or Event 5.
   - Event 4: 19:56 - 21:56 (this conflicts with Event 5, and it has a lower weight, so let's remove it)
   - Event 5: 21:29 - 22:44 (this fits perfectly)

5. The final schedule without conflicts and respecting the highest priority is:
   - Event 1: 10:02 - 10:47
   - Event 2: 16:03 - 16:33
   - Event 3: 17:22 - 18:52
   - Event 5: 21:29 - 22:44

6. We need to ensure the schedule is in chronological order and no overlaps occur. The schedule meets all these conditions.
