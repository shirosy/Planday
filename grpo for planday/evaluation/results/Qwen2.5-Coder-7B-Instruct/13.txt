# Reason through the problem

1. **Identify the constraints and priorities:**
   - We need to respect the chronological order of the events.
   - Priority events (Deep cleaning the kitchen and Yoga class with Emily) carry more weight.
   - No overlaps are allowed, and in case of a conflict, the higher-priority event should be included.

2. **Assess the events:**
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:02 - 00:47, weight = 2)
   - Jogging at the park (02:00 - 03:30, weight = 1)
   - Walking with Bella (02:00 - 02:30, weight = 1)
   - Shopping at farmer's market (04:39 - 06:24, weight = 1)
   - Yoga class with Emily (18:30 - 20:00, weight = 2)

3. **Determine the schedule:**
   - The deep cleaning event should be scheduled as soon as possible since it has the highest weight.
   - The shopping event should be scheduled after the walking event, as it has a higher weight than the jogging event.
   - The yoga class with Emily should be scheduled at the end, as it has the highest weight among the non-priority events.

4. **Resolve conflicts:**
   - There is a conflict between the jogging and walking events. Both have the same weight (1), so we can keep either. However, yoga (weight 2) and walking (weight 1) conflict with both jogging and walking, so we need to choose the higher-priority event if it fits better with the schedule.
