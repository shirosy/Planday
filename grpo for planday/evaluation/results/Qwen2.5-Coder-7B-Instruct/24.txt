First, I'll list all the events and their priorities:
- Chess: 05:34-06:49 (weight = 1)
- Calculus lecture: 05:45-06:30 (weight = 1)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike: 08:03-09:48 (weight = 2)
- Researching in library: 08:28-09:13 (weight = 1)
- Group study for physics test: 10:38-11:53 (weight = 1)
- Chemistry experiment: 15:28-17:13 (weight = 2)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake: 16:41-17:41 (weight = 2)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen: 19:36-19:51 (weight = 1)

Next, I'll consider conflicts and weigh the events accordingly. The chemistry experiment has the highest priority, but it conflicts with the study session with Sarah and Mike. Since the study session is a priority and closer in time, I'll keep it and replace the chemistry experiment.

I also need to ensure that the priority meeting with Emma and Jake does not conflict with any other events. It's not in conflict with any other priority or normal events.

Finally, I'll adjust the remaining schedule to maximize the sum of weighted event durations while respecting chronological order and no overlaps.
