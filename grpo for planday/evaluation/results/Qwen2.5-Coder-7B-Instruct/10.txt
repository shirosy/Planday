To create an optimized schedule that respects all rules and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the events and their priorities.
2. Arrange the events in chronological order based on their start times.
3. Prioritize events based on their weight (2 for high priority, 1 for normal).
4. Resolve any conflicts by giving priority to the higher weight event.

Here are the events in chronological order:
1. Jam session (02:01 - 03:46)
2. Sum 41 concert (04:38 - 06:23)
3. Backstage tour VIP pass (13:15 - 14:15)
4. David Guetta DJ set (17:23 - 18:23)
5. Silent disco party (17:59 - 18:59)

There are no conflicts detected among the events in chronological order. Therefore, we can include all events in the schedule.

Summing up the weighted durations:
- Jam session (1 hour 45 minutes - weight = 1): 105 minutes * 1 = 105 minutes
- Sum 41 concert (1 hour 45 minutes - weight = 1): 105 minutes * 1 = 105 minutes
- Backstage tour VIP pass (1 hour - weight = 2): 60 minutes * 2 = 120 minutes
- David Guetta DJ set (1 hour - weight = 1): 60 minutes * 1 = 60 minutes
- Silent disco party (1 hour - weight = 2): 60 minutes * 2 = 120 minutes

Total weighted duration = 105 + 105 + 120 + 60 + 120 = 510 minutes

Since all events fit within the given time frame without any conflicts and the sum of their weighted durations is maximized, this schedule is optimal.
