To optimize the schedule, we need to ensure that the Chemistry experiment, which is prioritized, is scheduled without conflict. The other events should follow in order to maximize the sum of weighted event durations. Let's analyze the given events:

1. Structural Dynamics lecture (09:50 - 10:05) - weight = 1
2. Chemistry experiment (11:18 - 12:48) - weight = 2
3. Researching in library (20:24 - 22:24) - weight = 1
4. Office hours with Prof. Chen (21:46 - 22:01) - weight = 1

The Chemistry experiment is the only prioritized event, so we need to avoid scheduling any events within its timeslot. We should then prioritize the remaining events, starting with the ones that have the highest weight.

1. Researching in library (20:24 - 22:24) - weight = 1
2. Structural Dynamics lecture (09:50 - 10:05) - weight = 1
3. Office hours with Prof. Chen (21:46 - 22:01) - weight = 1

In this order, the sum of weighted event durations is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the optimal schedule is:
