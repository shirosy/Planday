Let's reason through the problem to create the optimized schedule:

1. **Event Durations**:
   - 3D printing workshop: 30 minutes (01:17 - 01:47)
   - Trying new VR headset: 15 minutes (09:48 - 11:03)
   - Drone building hackathon: 15 minutes (11:04 - 11:19)
   - Live coding on Rust: 30 minutes (11:14 - 11:44)
   - Async Python talk: 30 minutes (19:41 - 20:11)
   - AI keynote: 20 minutes (20:26 - 22:26)
   - Networking with engineers: 1 hour 30 minutes (22:12 - 23:42)

2. **Priorities**:
   - Trying new VR headset (weight = 2)
   - Live coding on Rust (weight = 2)

3. **Constraints**:
   - No overlaps allowed.
   - Priority events must be included if slots are available.

4. **Optimization Goal**:
   - Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

**Analysis**:
   - Trying new VR headset (15 minutes, weight = 2)
   - Live coding on Rust (30 minutes, weight = 2)
   - Only 15 minutes between the two priority events, which means we can only fit one.
   - Async Python talk (30 minutes, weight = 1) overlaps with Live coding on Rust.
   - AI keynote (20 minutes, weight = 1) can start after Networking with engineers.
   - Networking with engineers (1.5 hours, weight = 1) is the longest event and should be ideally placed early to maximize space for other events.

**Optimized Schedule**:
   - Place "Networking with engineers" from 22:12 to 23:42 (weight = 1).
   - Follow up with "Live coding on Rust" from 23:42 to 00:12 (weight = 2).
   - After the breaks, fit other events based on available space.

**Final Scene**:
- Networking with engineers (22:12 - 23:42)
- Live coding on Rust (23:42 - 00:12)
- 3D printing workshop (01:17 - 01:47)
- Async Python talk (19:41 - 20:11)
- AI keynote (20:26 - 22:26)

**Remaining Slots Analysis**:
1. **19:41 - 20:11** - Async Python talk, but since it overlaps with Live coding on Rust, exclude it.
2. **20:26 - 22:26** - AI keynote, but it conflicts with Live coding on Rust and some network slots.
3. **Trying new VR headset** can only fit after other priority slots, but it overlaps with networking, thus excluded.
