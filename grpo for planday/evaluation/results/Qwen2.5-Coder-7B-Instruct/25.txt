- The Backstage tour VIP pass (16:49 - 17:34) has a high priority (weight = 2).
- The Jam session (19:29 - 20:29) also has a high priority (weight = 2).
- The Avril Lavigne concert (15:07 - 16:37), Silent disco party (17:32 - 19:17), Fireworks (17:59 - 18:44), and David Guetta DJ set (21:53 - 22:53) are normal events (weight = 1).
- The Backstage tour VIP pass cannot overlap with the Avril Lavigne concert, the Silent disco party, or the Fireworks.
- The Jam session cannot overlap with the Silent disco party, the Fireworks, or the David Guetta DJ set.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of weighted event durations, which is 2 + 2 = 4 hours (1 hour for each priority event).

Considering these points, the optimal schedule would be:
1. Start with the Backstage tour VIP pass (16:49 - 17:34).
2. Follow immediately with the concert (15:07 - 16:37) because its start time is earlier than the Backstage tour VIP pass.
3. Schedule the Fireworks (17:59 - 18:44) after the Backstage tour VIP pass.
4. Place the Silent disco party (17:32 - 19:17) immediately after the concert, filling the gap between the concert and the Fireworks.
5. Finally, schedule the Jam session (19:29 - 20:29) after the Silent disco party.

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations to 4 hours (1 hour for each priority event) without overlapping any events.
