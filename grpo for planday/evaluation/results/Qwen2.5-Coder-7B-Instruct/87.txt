1. First, let's analyze the given events:
   - Chess with Daniel: 02:19 - 03:04
   - Quantum computing guest talk: 02:52 - 04:07
   - Researching in library: 09:53 - 11:08
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake: 18:38 - 19:08

2. We need to prioritize the "Researching in library" with a weight of 2 because it has the highest priority.

3. Next, we need to schedule the events in chronological order, respecting the start and end times, and ensuring no overlaps. Priority events should be given precedence over normal events if there is a conflict.

4. Let's start with the "Chess with Daniel" event from 02:19 to 03:04. This is a normal event with a weight of 1.

5. The "Quantum computing guest talk" starts at 02:52 and ends at 04:07. This event overlaps with the "Chess with Daniel" but it has a weight of 1, so we can include it, as it has a later start time.

6. The "Researching in library" event from 09:53 to 11:08 is a priority event with a weight of 2. It should be scheduled next as it has the highest priority and no overlap with previous events.

7. Finally, the "Meeting with Emma and Jake" event from 18:38 to 19:08 can be scheduled last, as it has a weight of 1 and no overlap with the previously scheduled events.

Given these considerations, the optimized schedule is as follows:
