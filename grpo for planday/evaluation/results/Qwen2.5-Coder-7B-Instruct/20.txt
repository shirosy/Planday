To create the optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that there are no overlaps. The priorities are "Preparing PTO handover" (weight = 2) and "Replying to emails" (weight = 2).

1. **Preparing PTO handover** (03:57 - 05:27) - This event has the highest priority due to its higher weight.
2. **Replying to emails** (01:37 - 03:22) - This event also has a high priority due to its higher weight.
3. **Client call with Acme Corp** (03:35 - 04:20) - This event conflicts with the "Preparing PTO handover" and "Replying to emails" events, so it should be excluded.
4. **One-on-one with manager** (12:01 - 13:46) - This event can be scheduled after the high-priority events are completed.
5. **Analyzing product performance** (19:01 - 21:01) - This event can be scheduled after the one-on-one with the manager is completed.

Let's create the schedule by placing the high-priority events first, ensuring there are no overlaps, and then scheduling the lower-priority events.

Initial schedule (without exclusions):
- Q1 revenue report writing (00:29 - 02:29)
- Replying to emails (01:37 - 03:22)
- Client call with Acme Corp (03:35 - 04:20)
- Preparing PTO handover (03:57 - 05:27)
- One-on-one with manager (12:01 - 13:46)
- Analyzing product performance (19:01 - 21:01)

Exclusions and final schedule:
- "Client call with Acme Corp" conflicts with "Preparing PTO handover, " so it is excluded.
- "Replied to emails" aligns well with "Preparing PTO handover" since it finishes just before the start of the "Preparing PTO handover."

Final schedule:
- Q1 revenue report writing (00:29 - 02:29)
- Replying to emails (01:37 - 03:22)
- Preparing PTO handover (03:57 - 05:27)
- One-on-one with manager (12:01 - 13:46)
- Analyzing product performance (19:01 - 21:01)
