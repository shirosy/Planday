The task requires creating an optimized schedule that respects chronological order, event start and end times, priority events, and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations. We need to ensure no overlaps and include only the events that fit these criteria. The priority event is the "Client call with Acme Corp" which has a weight of 2.

Here's the breakdown:
1. "Q1 revenue report writing" is from 00:19 to 00:34 (15 minutes).
2. "Client call with Acme Corp" is from 15:43 to 17:13 (1 hour 30 minutes) and is priority.
3. "Updating website content" is from 20:54 to 21:24 (30 minutes).
4. "Analyzing product performance" is from 21:04 to 21:34 (30 minutes).

Since "Client call with Acme Corp" has a higher priority weight and overlaps with "Updating website content" and "Analyzing product performance," it must be included and no other events should interfere with it. "Q1 revenue report writing" starts before the priority event, so it can be included before it. 

These are the only possible slots that fit the criteria:
- "Q1 revenue report writing" from 00:19 to 00:34.
- "Client call with Acme Corp" from 15:43 to 17:13.
- Event excluded: Updating website content.
- Event excluded: Analyzing product performance.
