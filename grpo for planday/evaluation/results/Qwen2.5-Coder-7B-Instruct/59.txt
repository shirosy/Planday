To create the optimized schedule, we need to prioritize the events based on their weights and ensure that there are no overlaps. The priority events are "Calling Mom and Dad" (weight = 2) and "Deep cleaning the kitchen" (weight = 2). Let's start by listing the events and their priorities:

1. Reading 'Dune' (01:44 - 03:29) - weight = 1
2. Planting flowers in the garden (18:30 - 20:30) - weight = 1
3. Walking with Bella (21:40 - 23:25) - weight = 1

Priorities:
1. Calling Mom and Dad (11:59 - 13:44) - weight = 2
2. Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:57 - 16:42) - weight = 2

We need to place the priority events first and make sure they do not overlap with each other or with other events. The total duration of the priority events is:
90 minutes (11:59 - 13:44) + 45 minutes (15:57 - 16:42) = 135 minutes

This leaves us with the following time slots:
- From 01:44 to 11:59
- From 13:44 to 15:57
- From 16:42 to 18:30
- From 20:30 to 21:40
- From 23:25 to end of day

However, we need to include at least one of the non-priority events (either reading 'Dune', planting flowers in the garden, or walking with Bella) to reach the total of 1440 minutes (24 hours). Let's choose "Walking with Bella" (21:40 - 23:25) because it is the shortest and will fit into the remaining time. This leaves us with no conflicts and maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.

Now, let's construct the final schedule:
