To create an optimized schedule that respects the given rules, we need to carefully arrange the events in chronological order while prioritizing high-weighted events. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **List all events and their weights:**
   - Async Python talk (17:52 - 19:22) - Weight: 2
   - Networking with engineers (05:39 - 06:09) - Weight: 2
   - AI keynote (05:40 - 07:40) - Weight: 1
   - Web3 panel discussion (14:56 - 16:26) - Weight: 1
   - Digital detox meditation session (16:05 - 16:50) - Weight: 1
   - Trying new VR headset (21:27 - 21:57) - Weight: 1

2. **Identify conflicts and prioritize:**
   - The Async Python talk is a priority, so it cannot be removed.
   - The Networking with engineers is the other priority, also essential.

3. **Arrange events in strict chronological order:**
   - First, place the AI keynote (05:40 - 07:40) as it spans a significant portion of the schedule.
   - Next, fit the Networking with engineers (05:39 - 06:09) within the AI keynote slot without overlap.
   - Then, place the Web3 panel discussion (14:56 - 16:26) and the Digital detox meditation session (16:05 - 16:50) without overlap.
   - Finally, fit the Async Python talk (17:52 - 19:22) and the Trying new VR headset (21:27 - 21:57) at the end of the schedule.

4. **Check for any conflicts and ensure proper weight allocation:**
   - Ensure all events are non-overlapping.
   - Confirm that priority events (Async Python talk and Networking with engineers) are placed earlier if their actual start times allow.

5. **Calculate the sum of weighted event durations:**
   - Async Python talk (17:52 - 19:22) - 60 minutes
   - Networking with engineers (05:39 - 06:09) - 30 minutes
   - Total = 90 minutes
