To create an optimized schedule, I need to follow the given rules and prioritize the events accordingly. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify Priorities**: The priority events are "Reading 'Dune'" (weight = 2) and "Walking with Bella" (weight = 2).
2. **List Events**: All events must be included in the schedule, but only the priority events can be given more weight by placing them earlier where possible.
3. ** czas poszukiwania**:
    - "Reading 'Dune'" (14:47 - 15:17)
    - Walking with Bella (08:22 - 09:07)
    - Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:48 - 16:33)
    - Jogging at the park (16:21 - 16:51)
    - Planting flowers in the garden (17:29 - 19:29)
    - Shopping at farmer's market (01:48 - 03:18)

4. **Inclusion**:
    - Both priority events will be included in the optimized schedule.
    - Conflicts will be resolved by considering the event with the higher weight (which is already ensured as both have the same weight).

5. **Optimization**:
    - Since "Reading 'Dune'" and "Walking with Bella" are priority, we should attempt to place them earlier, but only if it doesn't conflict with their actual start times or any other event.

The final optimized schedule should consider the priority and sequence of events based on their absolute times and respect the rules.
