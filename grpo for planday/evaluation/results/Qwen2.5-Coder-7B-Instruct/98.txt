1. First, I will list all the events with their exact times and priorities.
2. Then, I will sort them in chronological order.
3. I will then prioritize the events based on their start times, respecting the priority of "Chess with Daniel".
4. If there are conflicts due to overlaps or higher priority events, I will remove the lower priority event or split the events if possible.
5. Finally, I will ensure that the sum of weighted event durations is maximized.
