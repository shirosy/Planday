To create the optimized schedule, I need to follow the given rules and prioritize events based on their start times and weights. Since the chemistry experiment has the highest priority (weight = 2), it should be included in the schedule. The other events should be placed in chronological order while respecting their start and end times.

1. Chemistry experiment (21:02 - 22:02) - Highest priority, must include.
2. Study session with Sarah and Mike (21:13 - 23:13) - Conflict with Chemistry experiment, must exclude.
3. Researching in library (03:27 - 03:57) - Normal event, can include.
4. Office hours with Prof. Chen (05:52 - 07:52) - Normal event, can include.
5. Structural Dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10) - Normal event, can include.

The study session with Sarah and Mike conflicts with the Chemistry experiment, so it must be excluded. The remaining events can be scheduled as follows:

- Start the day with Researching in library (03:27 - 03:57).
- Proceed to Office hours with Prof. Chen (05:52 - 07:52).
- End the day with Structural Dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10).
