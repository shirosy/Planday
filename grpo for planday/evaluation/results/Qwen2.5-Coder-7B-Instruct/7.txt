To create the optimized schedule while respecting the rules, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their start and end times.
2. Identify the normal events and their start and end times.
3. Place the priority events first in the schedule, followed by the normal events, ensuring no overlaps.
4. Ensure the schedule is in strict chronological order.
5. Calculate the sum of weighted event durations to maximize the result.

Given events:
- Digital detox meditation session (01:20 - 02:35)
- Web3 panel discussion (05:56 - 06:26)
- Live coding on Rust (13:34 - 15:34)
- 3D printing workshop (13:49 - 14:34)

Priorities: 3D printing workshop (weight = 2)

First, we place the 3D printing workshop, as it is the highest priority:
1. 3D printing workshop: 13:49 - 14:34

Next, we list the remaining events:
- Digital detox meditation session: 01:20 - 02:35
- Web3 panel discussion: 05:56 - 06:26
- Live coding on Rust: 13:34 - 15:34

Now, we place the normal events, ensuring no overlaps:
2. Digital detox meditation session: 01:20 - 02:35
3. Web3 panel discussion: 05:56 - 06:26

Finally, we place the live coding on Rust event last, as it does not conflict with the 3D printing workshop:
4. Live coding on Rust: 13:34 - 15:34

The final schedule is:
