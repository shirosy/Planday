1. Analyze events and their durations:
   - Structural Dynamics lecture: 45 minutes
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 2 hours
   - Chemistry experiment: 1 hour and 45 minutes
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake: 15 minutes
   - Chess with Daniel: 2 hours
   - Group study for physics test: 1 hour and 45 minutes

2. Identify prioritized events:
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake (priority event)

3. Check for conflicts and ensure no overlaps:
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake from 09:54 to 10:09 has no overlap with any other events.

4. Schedule all non-overlapping events in chronological order:
   - Structural Dynamics lecture (00:34 - 01:19)
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:20 - 03:20)
   - Chemistry experiment (08:12 - 09:57)
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake (09:54 - 10:09)
   - Chess with Daniel (19:03 - 21:03)
   - Group study for physics test (19:41 - 21:26)

5. Calculate the sum of weighted event durations:
   - Structural Dynamics: 45 minutes * 1 = 45
   - Calculus lecture: 120 minutes * 1 = 120
   - Chemistry experiment: 105 minutes * 1 = 105
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake: 15 minutes * 2 = 30
   - Chess with Daniel: 120 minutes * 1 = 120
   - Group study: 105 minutes * 1 = 105
   - Total = 525 minutes

6. Ensure all events fit within a 24-hour day and no overlapping occurs.
