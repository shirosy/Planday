Let's analyze and prioritize the events based on the given rules and priorities.

1. **Trying new VR headset (09:16 - 10:16)**, which is a normal event.
2. **Web3 panel discussion (10:27 - 12:12)**, which has priority weight 2.
3. **Live coding on Rust (11:28 - 12:58)**, which also has priority weight 2.
4. **Drone building hackathon (20:32 - 22:02)**, which is a normal event.
5. **AI keynote (21:19 - 22:19)**, which is a normal event.

The Web3 panel discussion starts at 10:27 and ends at 12:12. The Live coding on Rust starts at 11:28, which overlaps with the Web3 panel discussion. Since both have priority weight 2, we need to prioritize them based on their actual start times. The Web3 panel discussion should be kept as it starts earlier.

The Live coding on Rust starts after the Web3 panel discussion ends, so it's fine to include it.

The Trying new VR headset and Drone building hackathon do not conflict with any other events and are normal weight. The AI keynote also does not conflict with any other events and is of normal weight.

To maximize the sum of weighted event durations, we should include all non-conflicting events and prioritize the Web3 panel discussion and Live coding on Rust.

Final schedule:
- Trying new VR headset (09:16 - 10:16)
- Web3 panel discussion (10:27 - 12:12)
- Live coding on Rust (11:28 - 12:58)
- Drone building hackathon (20:32 - 22:02)
- AI keynote (21:19 - 22:19)
