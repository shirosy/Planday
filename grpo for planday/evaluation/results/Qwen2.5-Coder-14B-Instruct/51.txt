1. **Chronological Order**: All events are already in chronological order.
2. **No Overlapping**: We need to check for overlaps and ensure the AI keynote (priority event) is scheduled correctly.
3. **Weighted Time**: The AI keynote has a weight of 2, while the others have a weight of 1. If there is an overlap, the event with the higher weighted time should be included.
4. **Maximize Weighted Event Duration**: We need to ensure that the schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations.

**Event Details**:
- Async Python talk (08:21 - 09:21)
- AI keynote (10:47 - 11:47)
- Web3 panel discussion (11:45 - 12:15)
- Drone building hackathon (12:26 - 14:11)

**Checking for Overlaps**:
- The AI keynote (10:47 - 11:47) overlaps with Web3 panel discussion (11:45 - 12:15). Since the AI keynote has a higher weight (2), we will include it and exclude the Web3 panel discussion.

**Final Schedule**:
- Async Python talk (08:21 - 09:21)
- AI keynote (10:47 - 11:47)
- Drone building hackathon (12:26 - 14:11)
