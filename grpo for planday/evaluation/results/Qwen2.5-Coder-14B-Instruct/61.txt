Let's start by listing all events with their start and end times:

1. Fireworks (00:06 - 01:36)
2. The Killers concert (00:08 - 00:38)
3. Sum 41 concert (15:29 - 16:59)
4. David Guetta DJ set (19:50 - 20:50)
5. Jam session (19:50 - 20:50)

Next, let's assign priorities:
- David Guetta DJ set (weight = 2)
- The Killers concert (weight = 1)

Now, let's consider the chronological order and conflicts:
- The Killers concert starts at 00:08 and ends at 00:38.
- Fireworks overlap with The Killers concert. Since Fireworks have a much longer duration (1.5 hours vs 0.6 hours), and have lower priority, we should exclude Fireworks.
- Sum 41 concert starts later (15:29) and does not conflict with any other events.
- David Guetta DJ set starts at 19:50 and has a higher priority than Jam session. We will include David Guetta DJ set.

Now we can create the schedule based on these considerations.
