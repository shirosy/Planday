To create an optimized schedule based on the given rules, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The 3D printing workshop has the highest priority.
2. **Check Event Overlaps**: Ensure that we do not overlap the priority events with other events.
3. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: Since the priority event has more weight, it should be included if possible.
4. **Construct the Schedule**: Place the events in chronological order while respecting the priorities and non-overlap rule.

Let's evaluate the provided events:

- **Digital detox meditation session (01:20 - 02:35)**: No overlap with priority event, low weight.
- **Web3 panel discussion (05:56 - 06:26)**: No overlap with priority event, low weight.
- **Live coding on Rust (13:34 - 15:34)**: Overlaps with 3D printing workshop; omit since the priority event has higher weight.
- **3D printing workshop (13:49 - 14:34)**: No overlap with other events, high priority.

The optimal schedule will include the events in order while respecting the priority rule.
