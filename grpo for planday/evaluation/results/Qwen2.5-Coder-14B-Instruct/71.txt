To create an optimized schedule based on the given events and rules, I need to prioritize events according to their start times and weights. The Q1 revenue report writing is a priority event with weight 2, so it should be placed first if possible. I then need to check for any overlaps and ensure chronological order is maintained.

1. **Q1 revenue report writing** (00:37 - 02:07) - Weight: 2
   - This event starts at 00:37 and ends at 02:07.

2. **Marketing standup on Zoom** (00:38 - 02:23) - Weight: 1
   - This event starts at 00:38 and ends at 02:23.
   - There is an overlap with the Q1 revenue report writing event, so we exclude this event due to the higher weight of the priority event.

3. **One-on-one with manager** (09:43 - 10:58) - Weight: 1
   - This event starts at 09:43 and ends at 10:58.
   - No overlap with previous events.

4. **Replying to emails** (10:42 - 12:12) - Weight: 1
   - This event starts at 10:42 and ends at 12:12.
   - Overlaps with the one-on-one with manager event from 09:43 to 10:58.
   - Since the overlapping duration (10:42 - 10:58) is less than the duration of the one-on-one meeting (10:43 - 10:58), we exclude this event.

5. **Meeting with Lisa at café** (17:07 - 17:22) - Weight: 1
   - This event starts at 17:07 and ends at 17:22.
   - No overlap with previous events.

The final schedule will include:
- Q1 revenue report writing (00:37 - 02:07)
- One-on-one with manager (09:43 - 10:58)
- Meeting with Lisa at café (17:07 - 17:22)
