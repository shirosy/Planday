Given thepriority of Trying new VR headset, we must ensure it fits alongside other events without causing overlaps. We'll start by placing the priority event and then fill in the remaining slots with other events, prioritizing those that do not overlap with the high-priority event.

1. Place the priority event: Trying new VR headset (16:47 - 17:17)
2. Analyze the remaining time slots:
   - Before 16:47: 
     - Async Python talk (05:46 - 07:46)
     - Live coding on Rust (06:39 - 08:09)
   - After 17:17:
     - 3D printing workshop (15:34 - 17:34) cannot be placed because it overlaps with the priority event.
     - AI keynote (11:39 - 12:24) does not overlap and can be included.

3. We can fit Async Python talk and AI keynote in their respective slots without conflicts.
4. Live coding on Rust conflicts with Async Python talk, so we cannot include it.
