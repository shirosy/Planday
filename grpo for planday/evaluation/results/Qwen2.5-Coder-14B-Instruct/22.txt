1. **Review Events and Priorities**:
   - Yoga class with Emily: 03:51 - 05:21 (Normal, weight = 1, duration = 70 minutes)
   - Cooking pasta: 04:01 - 05:16 (Normal, weight = 1, duration = 75 minutes)
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen: 09:02 - 10:02 (Normal, weight = 1, duration = 60 minutes)
   - Watching 'Inception': 16:54 - 18:39 (Priority, weight = 2, duration = 85 minutes)

2. **Identify Conflicts**:
   - Yoga class with Emily and Cooking pasta overlap from 04:01 to 05:16.
   - No other overlaps are present between the remaining events.

3. **Resolve Conflicts Based on Priority**:
   - Since Cooking pasta has a higher weighted duration (75) compared to Yoga class with Emily (70), we should include Cooking pasta.
   - Exclude Yoga class with Emily to resolve the conflict.

4. **Final Schedule**:
   - Include: Cooking pasta (04:01 - 05:16), Deep cleaning the kitchen (09:02 - 10:02), Watching 'Inception' (16:54 - 18:39).
   - Exclude: Yoga class with Emily.
