To create the optimized schedule, we need to consider the chronological order of events, their weights, and ensure no overlaps. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Drone building hackathon (06:52 - 08:07)**
2. **Small Language Models talk (07:05 - 08:50)** - This event overlaps with the drone building hackathon from 07:05 to 08:07. Since there are no priorities involved, we can exclude this event.
3. **Async Python talk (16:05 - 16:20)**
4. **AI keynote (16:35 - 18:35)** - This event overlaps with the async Python talk. Since the AI keynote is a priority event, it should take precedence over the async Python talk.
5. **Networking with engineers (18:01 - 18:16)**
6. **Digital detox meditation session (18:53 - 19:23)** - This is a priority event.
7. **Live coding on Rust (19:45 - 21:00)**

Now, we will construct the schedule by ensuring that all events are in strict chronological order and prioritize the required events.
