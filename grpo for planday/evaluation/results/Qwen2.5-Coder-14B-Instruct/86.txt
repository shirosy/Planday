1. **Identify Priority Events and Regular Events:**
   - Priority Event: Updating website content (00:44 - 01:14, weight = 2)
   - Regular Events:
     - Q1 revenue report writing (00:26 - 00:56, weight = 1)
     - One-on-one with manager (03:32 - 05:32, weight = 1)
     - Analyzing product performance (13:03 - 13:18, weight = 1)
     - Replying to emails (16:53 - 17:53, weight = 1)
     - Preparing PTO handover (19:18 - 21:03, weight = 1)

2. **Chronological Order and Conflict Resolution:**
   - The priority event (Updating website content) starts at 00:44 and ends at 01:14. It overlaps with the regular event (Q1 revenue report writing) which starts at 00:26 and ends at 00:56.
   - The regular event (Q1 revenue report writing) is excluded due to the overlap with the priority event.

3. **Schedule Construction:**
   - The final schedule should include the priority event and all other regular events that do not overlap with each other and conflict-free.
   - The order of events should respect their start times.
