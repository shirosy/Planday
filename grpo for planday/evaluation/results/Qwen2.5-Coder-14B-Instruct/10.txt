1. First, identify the absolute start and end times for all events.
2. Determine the weights for each event based on the given priorities.
   - Silent disco party: weight = 2
   - Backstage tour VIP pass: weight = 2
   - Jam session: weight = 1
   - Sum 41 concert: weight = 1
   - David Guetta DJ set: weight = 1
3. Create a chronological list of events.
4. Check for conflicts and resolve them by excluding events with lower weighted time.
5. Ensure no overlaps between events.
6. Output the final schedule in the required format.
