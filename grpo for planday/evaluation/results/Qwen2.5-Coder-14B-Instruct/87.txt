Let's analyze the events and their priorities:

1. Chess with Daniel (02:19 - 03:04) - Priority: 1
2. Quantum computing guest talk (02:52 - 04:07) - Priority: 1
3. Researching in library (09:53 - 11:08) - Priority: 2 (highest weight)
4. Meeting with Emma and Jake (18:38 - 19:08) - Priority: 1

The key priority event is "Researching in library" with a weight of 2, which means it should be included in the schedule if possible.

First, let's look for conflicts:
- Chess with Daniel (02:19 - 03:04) does not overlap with any other event.
- Quantum computing guest talk (02:52 - 04:07) overlaps with Chess with Daniel (02:19 - 03:04) and the start of Researching in library (09:53 - 11:08). However, since Researching in library has higher priority, we will prioritize it and exclude Chess with Daniel.
- Researching in library (09:53 - 11:08) does not overlap with any other event once Chess with Daniel is excluded.
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (18:38 - 19:08) does not overlap with any other event.

So, we can include all events except Chess with Daniel.
