Let's reason through the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Priority Events**:
   - Async Python talk (17:52 - 19:22) with weight = 2
   - Networking with engineers (05:39 - 06:09) with weight = 2

2. **List All Events**:
   - Networking with engineers (05:39 - 06:09)
   - AI keynote (05:40 - 07:40)
   - Web3 panel discussion (14:56 - 16:26)
   - Digital detox meditation session (16:05 - 16:50)
   - Async Python talk (17:52 - 19:22)
   - Trying new VR headset (21:27 - 21:57)

3. **Check for Conflicts and Prioritize Priority Events**:
   - Networking with engineers starts at 05:39 and ends at 06:09. This event has no conflicts with other events except AI keynote, which starts at 05:40. Since the networking event is earlier, we include it.
   - AI keynote overlaps with Networking with engineers, but Networking have a higher priority due to its earlier start time, so we exclude AI keynote.
   - Web3 panel discussion (14:56 - 16:26) can be included without conflict.
   - Digital detox meditation session (16:05 - 16:50) can be included without conflict.
   - Async Python talk (17:52 - 19:22) has a high priority and no conflicts with other events, so we include it.
   - Trying new VR headset (21:27 - 21:57) can be included without conflict.

4. **Construct the Schedule**:
   - Follow chronological order and include all non-conflicting events, giving priority to the priority events.
