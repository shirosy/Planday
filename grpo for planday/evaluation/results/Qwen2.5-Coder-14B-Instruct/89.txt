1. **Identify Priority Events**: The only priority event is "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams" with a weight of 2.
2. **Chronological Order**: Arrange events by their start times.
3. **Avoid Overlaps**: Ensure no two events overlap. In case of conflict, keep the event with the higher weight.
4. **Maximize Weighted Durations**: Include as many events as possible without overlaps, giving higher priority to events with higher weights.

**Event Durations (in minutes)**:
- Researching in library: 30
- Office hours with Prof. Chen: 170
- Chemistry experiment: 120
- Structural Dynamics lecture: 95
- Study session with Sarah and Mike: 45
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 75

**Priority Event**:
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (09:40 PM - 10:55 PM)

**Conflicts and Resolutions**:
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (01:58 PM - 03:28 PM) conflicts with Researching in library (01:53 PM - 02:23 PM). Office hours with Prof. Chen has a higher weight (170 minutes), so keep the office hours.
- Structural Dynamics lecture (05:42 PM - 06:57 PM) does not conflict with any other events.
- Chemistry experiment (03:21 PM - 05:21 PM) conflicts with Office hours with Prof. Chen. Remove Chemistry experiment.
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (06:49 PM - 07:34 PM) conflicts with Structural Dynamics lecture. Remove Study session.

**Final Schedule**:
- Researching in library (01:53 PM - 02:23 PM) is not included due to conflict with Office hours.
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (01:58 PM - 03:28 PM) is included.
- Chemistry experiment (03:21 PM - 05:21 PM) is excluded due to conflict with Office hours.
- Structural Dynamics lecture (05:42 PM - 06:57 PM) is included.
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (06:49 PM - 07:34 PM) is excluded due to conflict with Structural Dynamics lecture.
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (09:40 PM - 10:55 PM) is included due to its high priority.
