Let's analyze the events and prioritize them based on the given rules and priorities.

1. **Chess with Daniel** (15:07 - 15:52) - Priority Event (weight = 2)
   - This must be kept in the schedule as it has the highest priority.

2. **Chemistry experiment** (03:56 - 04:56)
   - This is a normal event (weight = 1).

3. **Office hours with Prof. Chen** (10:43 - 11:43)
   - This is a normal event (weight = 1).

4. **Researching in library** (12:16 - 14:16)
   - This is a normal event (weight = 1).

5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams** (14:54 - 16:09)
   - This is a normal event (weight = 1).

6. **Group study for physics test** (18:06 - 18:51)
   - This is a normal event (weight = 1).

Now, let's order the events chronologically:
- 03:56 - 04:56: Chemistry experiment
- 10:43 - 11:43: Office hours with Prof. Chen
- 12:16 - 14:16: Researching in library
- 14:54 - 16:09: Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams
- 15:07 - 15:52: Chess with Daniel
- 18:06 - 18:51: Group study for physics test

Since Chess with Daniel overlaps with Calculus lecture but has higher weight, we will include Chess with Daniel and exclude Calculus lecture.
