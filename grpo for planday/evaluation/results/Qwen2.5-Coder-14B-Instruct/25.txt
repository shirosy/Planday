1. **Identify priority events**:
   - Backstage tour VIP pass (16:49 - 17:34) with weight 2
   - Jam session (19:29 - 20:29) with weight 2

2. **List other events**:
   - Avril Lavigne concert (15:07 - 16:37) with weight 1
   - Silent disco party (17:32 - 19:17) with weight 1
   - Fireworks (17:59 - 18:44) with weight 1
   - David Guetta DJ set (21:53 - 22:53) with weight 1

3. **Check for overlaps and resolve conflicts**:
   - The Silent disco party (17:32 - 19:17) overlaps with the Fireworks (17:59 - 18:44) but since they do not conflict strongly, we can include both.
   - The Backstage tour VIP pass (16:49 - 17:34) conflicts with the Silent disco party (17:32 - 19:17), but since the Backstage tour VIP pass has higher weight, it should be included instead.

4. **Construct the schedule**:
   - Start with the earliest event and add events in chronological order, resolving conflicts as per the rules.
