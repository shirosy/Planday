Let's analyze the events and their scheduling constraints:

1. **Cooking Pasta (02:12 - 02:27)** - Priority 1
2. **Shopping at Farmers Market (02:23 - 02:38)** - Priority 1
3. **Calling Mom and Dad (06:02 - 08:02)** - Priority 1
4. **Deep Cleaning the Kitchen (15:40 - 16:40)** - Priority 2
5. **Watching 'Inception' (20:37 - 22:07)** - Priority 1

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Event Conflicts and Priorities**:
   - Cooking Pasta and Shopping at Farmer's Market overlap, but since both are Priority 1, we need to choose one.
   - Deep Cleaning the Kitchen is a Priority 2 event, so it has higher priority over any other conflicting Priority 1 event.
   - There are no other overlaps among the remaining events after excluding the conflicting ones.

2. **Optimal Selection**:
   - Exclude the Cooking Pasta event because it conflicts with Shopping at Farmer's Market.
   - Include Deep Cleaning the Kitchen because it has a higher priority and is non-conflicting.
   - Include all other non-conflicting events.

### Final Selection:
- Shopping at Farmer's Market (02:23 - 02:38)
- Calling Mom and Dad (06:02 - 08:02)
- Deep Cleaning the Kitchen (15:40 - 16:40)
- Watching 'Inception' (20:37 - 22:07)
