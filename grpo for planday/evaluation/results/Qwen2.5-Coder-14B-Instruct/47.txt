1. **Event Listing with Durations**:
   - Analyzing product performance (01:11 - 01:56) -> 45 minutes
   - Client call with Acme Corp (06:34 - 07:19) -> 45 minutes
   - Marketing standup on Zoom (14:51 - 15:51) -> 60 minutes
   - Q1 revenue report writing (15:19 - 16:04) -> 45 minutes

2. **Priorities**:
   - Marketing standup on Zoom (Weight = 2)

3. **Sorting and Conflict Resolution**:
   - All events are non-overlapping, so they can be listed in their chronological order.
   - "Marketing standup on Zoom" is the highest priority, and since it conflicts with "Q1 revenue report writing," we'll exclude "Q1 revenue report writing" to maximize the weighted duration.
