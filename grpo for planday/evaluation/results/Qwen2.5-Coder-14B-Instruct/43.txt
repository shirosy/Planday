To optimize the schedule based on the given events and priorities, I will consider the following:

1. Identify the absolute start and end times for each event.
2. Prioritize events with higher weights (Live coding on Rust and Web3 panel discussion).
3. Ensure no overlaps and respect chronological order.
4. Calculate the sum of weighted event durations to maximize it.

Let's break down the events:

1. Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14)
2. Web3 panel discussion (06:08 - 08:08)
3. Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23)
4. Async Python talk (20:18 - 22:18)
5. Small Language Models talk (20:35 - 22:35)

Since Live coding on Rust and Web3 panel discussion are prioritized, we will ensure these are included first if they don't overlap. The remaining events will be added if they fit without overlapping.

Let's construct the schedule:
1. Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14)
2. Web3 panel discussion (06:08 - 08:08) - conflicts with Digital detox meditation session, so excluding it.
3. Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23)
4. Async Python talk (20:18 - 22:18) - conflicts with Small Language Models talk, so excluding it.

This results in the following schedule with the maximum sum of weighted event durations:

- Digital detox meditation session (05:59 - 06:14) - 1 weight 14 minutes
- Web3 panel discussion (06:08 - 08:08) - 2 weight 120 minutes
- Live coding on Rust (11:23 - 12:23) - 2 weight 60 minutes
