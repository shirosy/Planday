1. First, I'll list all events with their start and end times.
2. I'll mark the priority event with a higher weight.
3. I'll then check for conflicts and prioritize events with higher weighted times.
4. If there are conflicts, I'll exclude events to maximize the sum of weighted event durations, following the given rules.
