Let's analyze the events and prioritize them based on the rules provided:

1. **David Bowie tribute concert** (03:15 - 03:30) - Normal event (weight 1)
2. **Sum 41 concert** (12:56 - 14:41) - Priority event (weight 2)
3. **Jam session** (21:44 - 21:59) - Normal event (weight 1)
4. **David Guetta DJ set** (21:54 - 23:24) - Normal event (weight 1)

Since the Sum 41 concert is a priority event, it must be included in the schedule. If there are any overlapping events, we will exclude the one with the lower weighted time.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
- The David Bowie tribute concert starts at 03:15 and ends at 03:30.
- The Sum 41 concert starts at 12:56 and ends at 14:41. This does not overlap with the David Bowie tribute concert.
- The Jam session starts at 21:44 and ends at 21:59, which overlaps with the David Guetta DJ set that starts at 21:54 and ends at 23:24. Since the Jam session has a lower weight (1) compared to the David Guetta DJ set (1, normal event), we will exclude the Jam session.

Final Schedule:
1. David Bowie tribute concert
2. Sum 41 concert
3. David Guetta DJ set
