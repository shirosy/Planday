First, let's identify the events and their durations in hours:

1. Fireworks: 1.5 hours
2. David Guetta DJ set: 1.25 hours
3. Silent disco party: 1.75 hours
4. Jam session: 2 hours
5. Sum 41 concert: 2 hours
6. The Killers concert: 0.5 hours
7. Korean BBQ food trucks: 2 hours
8. Backstage tour VIP pass: 1.75 hours

Next, we need to plan the schedule while respecting the given rules. The priority event is Fireworks, which must be included. We will then try to fit the other events in a way that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without overlaps.

### Schedule Planning:
1. **Fireworks (00:14 - 01:44)**: Priority event, must be included.
2. **David Guetta DJ set (03:01 - 04:16)**: Can be scheduled after Fireworks.
3. **Sum 41 concert (11:00 - 13:00)**: Conflicts with the Jam session (10:46 - 12:46) and Silent disco party (10:15 - 12:00). We need to choose between these conflicts.
4. **The Killers concert (13:15 - 13:45)**: Does not conflict with any other event.
5. **Korean BBQ food trucks (19:05 - 21:05)**: Does not conflict with any other event.
6. **Backstage tour VIP pass (21:56 - 23:41)**: Does not conflict with any other event.

### Conflict Resolution:
- **Sum 41 concert vs. Silent disco party & Jam session**: The Jam session has a higher weight (2) compared to the Silent disco party (1). Therefore, we will exclude the Silent disco party and include the Jam session and the Sum 41 concert.

### Final Schedule:
1. Fireworks (00:14 - 01:44)
2. David Guetta DJ set (03:01 - 04:16)
3. Jam session (10:46 - 12:46)
4. Sum 41 concert (11:00 - 13:00)
5. The Killers concert (13:15 - 13:45)
6. Korean BBQ food trucks (19:05 - 21:05)
7. Backstage tour VIP pass (21:56 - 23:41)
