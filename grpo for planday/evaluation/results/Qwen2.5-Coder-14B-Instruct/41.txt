1. **Identify Events and Priorities**:
   - Structural Dynamics lecture: 02:35 - 04:35 (normal priority, weight = 1, duration = 2 hours)
   - Group study for physics test: 08:38 - 09:53 (normal priority, weight = 1, duration = 1 hour 15 minutes)
   - Chemistry experiment: 09:27 - 09:42 (normal priority, weight = 1, duration = 15 minutes)
   - Quantum computing guest talk: 11:02 - 12:17 (priority event, weight = 2, duration = 1 hour 15 minutes)
   
2. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   - The Quantum computing guest talk (02:35 - 04:35, weight = 2) conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture (02:35 - 04:35, weight = 1). Since the Quantum computing guest talk has a higher weight, we exclude the Structural Dynamics lecture.
   - The Group study for physics test (08:38 - 09:53, weight = 1) does not conflict with any other event.
   - The Chemistry experiment (09:27 - 09:42, weight = 1) does not conflict with any other event, but it overlaps with the Group study for physics test. Since their weights are equal, we prioritize the start time, and the Group study for physics test will run first.

3. **Final Schedule**:
   - Start with the first event.
   - Include subsequent events only if they do not overlap or if they have higher weights.
