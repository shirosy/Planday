Let's analyze the events to determine the optimal schedule.

1. **Client call with Acme Corp (06:20 - 07:35)** - Priority event.
2. **Analyzing product performance (13:27 - 15:12)** - Normal event.
3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (14:37 - 15:52)** - Normal event.
4. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (19:12 - 19:57)** - Normal event.

Since the client call with Acme Corp is a priority event and has the earliest start time, it must be included first. We need to check for overlaps and ensure all events respect the chronological order and priority rules.

**Overlap Check:**
- The client call ends at 07:35, so it doesn't overlap with any other event.
- Analyzing product performance starts at 13:27, which doesn't overlap with any other event.
- Marketing standup starts at 14:37, which doesn't overlap with analyzing product performance.
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick starts at 19:12, which doesn't overlap with any other event.

All events can be included without conflicts, and they respect the chronological order and priority.

**Calculate Weighted Event Durations:**
- Client call with Acme Corp (Priority, Duration: 1 hour 15 min): 1.25 * 2 = 2.5
- Analyzing product performance: 1.75 * 1 = 1.75
- Marketing standup on Zoom: 1.25 * 1 = 1.25
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick: 0.75 * 1 = 0.75

**Total Weighted Duration:**
2.5 + 1.75 + 1.25 + 0.75 = 6.25

This schedule maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any conflicts.
