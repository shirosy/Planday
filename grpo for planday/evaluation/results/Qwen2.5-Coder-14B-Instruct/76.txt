First, I'll list all the events and their start and end times. I'll also mark the priority event. 

1. Drone building hackathon: 00:08 - 00:53
2. AI keynote: 00:53 - 02:08
3. Async Python talk: 03:50 - 04:35
4. Web3 panel discussion (priority): 06:57 - 08:12
5. Trying new VR headset: 08:24 - 10:24
6. Live coding on Rust: 17:21 - 18:36
7. Small Language Models talk: 19:59 - 20:59

Next, I'll arrange them in chronological order and ensure the priority event (Web3 panel discussion) is included. Since there are no overlapping events that need to be resolved based on priority, I can include all events in the order they appear.

Finally, I'll calculate the total weighted duration to ensure I've optimized the schedule according to the rules.
