To create an optimized schedule, I'll follow these steps:
1. Identify priority events and ensure they are included.
2. Identify conflicting events and resolve them by comparing weights.
3. Arrange all events in chronological order.
4. Ensure no overlaps and maximize weighted event durations.

Priority events: 
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (weight = 2)

Other events:
- Structural Dynamics lecture (weight = 1)
- Researching in library (weight = 1)
- Chess with Daniel (weight = 1)

Conflicts to resolve:
- Chess with Daniel and Researching in library both start at 16:52, but Researching in library ends later. Chess with Daniel should be excluded as it has lower weight.
- Study session with Sarah and Mike does not conflict with any other events.

Final schedule:
- Structural Dynamics lecture (09:24 - 10:39)
- Researching in library (16:52 - 18:37)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (20:26 - 21:56)
