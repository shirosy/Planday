- The events must be scheduled in strict chronological order.
- priority events (Chess with Daniel and Meeting with Emma and Jake) must be given weight.
- Office hours and Calculus lecture are normal events and should be included unless overlapping with priority events.
- The schedule must be optimized to maximize the sum of weighted durations, prioritizing priority events where necessary.

Examining the events:
1. Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55) - priority (weight = 2)
2. Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45)
3. Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26)
4. Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13) - priority (weight = 2)
5. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58)

The Office hours with Prof. Chen (06:30 - 06:45) and Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (14:13 - 14:58) do not overlap with any priority events. The Meeting with Emma and Jake (04:55 - 06:55) and Chess with Daniel (07:43 - 08:13) both have a specific time window. The Structural Dynamics lecture (06:56 - 08:26) starts immediately after Meeting with Emma and Jake and overlaps with Chess with Daniel.

Since Meeting with Emma and Jake has a higher weight and starts earlier, it should be included. The Structural Dynamics lecture will have to be excluded to accommodate Chess with Daniel.

Final schedule based on the given rules and priorities:
