Let's analyze the events and their conflicts:

1. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (01:40 - 03:40)**
2. **Chess with Daniel (03:38 - 04:38)**
3. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (10:12 - 11:57)**
4. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (10:18 - 11:18)**
5. **Structural Dynamics lecture (13:30 - 14:45)**
6. **Researching in library (19:37 - 20:52)**

**Conflicts:**
- Chess with Daniel (03:38 - 04:38) overlaps with Calculus lecture (01:40 - 03:40).
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (10:18 - 11:18) overlaps with Study session with Sarah and Mike (10:12 - 11:57).
- Structural Dynamics lecture (13:30 - 14:45) does not overlap with any other events.

**Decisions:**
- Chess with Daniel is a priority event (weight = 2) and must be included. Therefore, we exclude the Calculus lecture.
- Meeting with Emma and Jake must be excluded to allow the Study session with Sarah and Mike to be included because it is a priority event (weight = 2).

**Final Schedule:**
- Chess with Daniel (03:38 - 04:38)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (10:12 - 11:57)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (13:30 - 14:45)
- Researching in library (19:37 - 20:52)
