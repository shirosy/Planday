First, I will list the events with their priorities and durations:
1. Walking with Bella (07:17 - 08:17, weight = 2, duration = 100 minutes)
2. Reading 'Dune' (07:59 - 09:29, weight = 2, duration = 150 minutes)
3. Cooking pasta (10:20 - 12:20, weight = 1, duration = 120 minutes)
4. Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:59 - 03:59, weight = 1, duration = 60 minutes)
5. Calling Mom and Dad (18:44 - 18:59, weight = 1, duration = 15 minutes)
6. Watching 'Inception' (18:58 - 19:58, weight = 1, duration = 60 minutes)

Now, let's arrange the events in chronological order and check for overlaps:
- Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:59 - 03:59)
- Walking with Bella (07:17 - 08:17)
- Reading 'Dune' (07:59 - 09:29) - overlaps with Walking with Bella, but Walking with Bella has a higher weight.
- Cooking pasta (10:20 - 12:20) - overlaps with Reading 'Dune', but Reading 'Dune' has a higher weight.
- Calling Mom and Dad (18:44 - 18:59)
- Watching 'Inception' (18:58 - 19:58) - overlaps with Calling Mom and Dad, but Calling Mom and Dad has a higher weight.

Since events with higher weights must be included and cannot overlap with events of equal or lower weight, we will include:
- Walking with Bella (07:17 - 08:17)
- Reading 'Dune' (07:59 - 09:29)
- Cooking pasta (10:20 - 12:20)
- Calling Mom and Dad (18:44 - 18:59)
- Watching 'Inception' (18:58 - 19:58)

We will exclude Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:59 - 03:59) because it conflicts with Walking with Bella and has a lower weight.
