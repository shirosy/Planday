To create an optimized schedule, we need to ensure that all events are respected in their given start and end times, and that priority events are given the highest possible weight.

1. **Priority Events**: 
   - Small Language Models talk: 21:40 - 22:55 (weight = 2)
   - Live coding on Rust: 20:27 - 21:57 (weight = 2)

2. **Normal Events**:
   - Trying new VR headset: 00:19 - 01:04 (weight = 1)
   - AI keynote: 04:33 - 04:48 (weight = 1)
   - Async Python talk: 04:46 - 06:01 (weight = 1)
   - Digital detox meditation session: 08:23 - 09:53 (weight = 1)
   - Web3 panel discussion: 10:15 - 10:45 (weight = 1)
   - Drone building hackathon: 17:13 - 18:43 (weight = 1)

3. **Step-by-Step Schedule Construction**:
   - Start with priority events since they have the highest weight.
   - Add normal events in chronological order, ensuring no overlaps with priority events.

4. **Resolution of Conflicts**:
   - If a normal event conflicts with a priority event, it will be excluded.

5. **Final Schedule**:
   - Trying new VR headset: 00:19 - 01:04
   - AI keynote: 04:33 - 04:48
   - Async Python talk: 04:46 - 06:01
   - Digital detox meditation session: 08:23 - 09:53
   - Web3 panel discussion: 10:15 - 10:45
   - Drone building hackathon: 17:13 - 18:43
   - Live coding on Rust: 20:27 - 21:57
   - Small Language Models talk: 21:40 - 22:55 

As both priority events fit within other events without conflicts and in their strict chronological order, no exclusions are necessary.
