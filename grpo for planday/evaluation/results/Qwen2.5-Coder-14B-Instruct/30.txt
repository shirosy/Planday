To create an optimized schedule, I will follow the given rules and prioritize events accordingly. The marketing standup on Zoom has the highest priority (weight = 2), so it must be included first. I'll then add other events while ensuring no overlaps and respecting chronological order. Finally, I'll maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom (11:43 - 12:13)** - Priority event, must be included.
2. **One-on-one with manager (01:17 - 01:32)** - Next earliest event, add after marketing standup.
3. **Preparing PTO handover (02:37 - 03:07)** - Add after one-on-one.
4. **Replying to emails (18:55 - 19:10)** - No overlap, add.
5. **Client call with Acme Corp (19:30 - 20:30)** - No overlap, add.
6. **Meeting with Lisa at café (19:58 - 21:58)** - Overlaps with client call, exclude as it has a lower weighted time.

In summary:
- Include: Marketing standup on Zoom, One-on-one with manager, Preparing PTO handover, Replying to emails, Client call with Acme Corp.
- Exclude: Meeting with Lisa at café
