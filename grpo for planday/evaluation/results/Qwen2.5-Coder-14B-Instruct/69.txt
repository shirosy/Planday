Let's go through the events and prioritize them based on the given rules. 

1. Meeting with Lisa at café (04:53 - 05:08) - Priority event.
2. Q1 revenue report writing (04:26 - 05:11)
3. One-on-one with manager (06:09 - 06:24)
4. Preparing PTO handover (12:27 - 13:57)
5. Analyzing product performance (15:09 - 16:54)
6. Updating website content (16:03 - 18:03)

First, we'll ensure the priority event (Meeting with Lisa at café) is included and does not overlap with others. 
- The Meeting with Lisa at café (04:53 - 05:08) conflicts with Q1 revenue report writing (04:26 - 05:11). Since the Meeting with Lisa has higher priority, we exclude Q1 revenue report writing.

Next, we'll place the remaining events in chronological order:

1. Meeting with Lisa at café (04:53 - 05:08)
2. One-on-one with manager (06:09 - 06:24)
3. Preparing PTO handover (12:27 - 13:57)
4. Analyzing product performance (15:09 - 16:54)
5. Updating website content (16:03 - 18:03)

We need to make sure there are no overlaps. Checking:
- One-on-one with manager (06:09 - 06:24) does not overlap with Meeting with Lisa at café.
- Preparing PTO handover (12:27 - 13:57) does not overlap with One-on-one with manager.
- Analyzing product performance (15:09 - 16:54) does not overlap with Preparing PTO handover.
- Updating website content (16:03 - 18:03) does not overlap with Analyzing product performance.

The schedule looks good without any conflicts. We have maximized the weighted event durations by including the high-priority event and maintaining chronological order.
