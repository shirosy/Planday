Let's first list the events in chronological order and identify the priority events.

Chronological Order:
1. Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:16 - 01:01)
2. Walking with Bella (06:50 - 07:50)
3. Calling Mom and Dad (14:52 - 16:22) - Priority event
4. Cooking pasta (18:28 - 19:13)
5. Jogging at the park (19:05 - 19:20)
6. Yoga class with Emily (20:35 - 22:05)

Now, let's check for any overlaps and decide which events to include based on their weights.

- There are no overlaps between any events.
- All events are in chronological order.

Since there are no overlaps, we can include all events in the schedule. TheCalling Mom and Dad is a priority event, so its weight is 2, and the rest have a weight of 1.

Let's calculate the weighted sum of durations:
- Deep cleaning the kitchen: 45 minutes * 1 = 45
- Walking with Bella: 60 minutes * 1 = 60
- Calling Mom and Dad: 1 hour 30 minutes * 2 = 300
- Cooking pasta: 45 minutes * 1 = 45
- Jogging at the park: 15 minutes * 1 = 15
- Yoga class with Emily: 1 hour 30 minutes * 1 = 90

Total weighted sum = 45 + 60 + 300 + 45 + 15 + 90 = 555

Since there are no conflicts or overlaps, we can include all events in the schedule.
