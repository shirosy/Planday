1. First, I'll review all the events and their priorities.
2. The priority event is "Watching 'Inception'" which starts at 01:29 and ends at 02:44.
3. I'll ensure that this event is included in the schedule.
4. Next, I'll look for conflicts with other events.
5. "Calling Mom and Dad" overlaps with "Watching 'Inception'" (02:02 - 02:17), but since "Calling Mom and Dad" has a lower weight, I'll exclude it.
6. "Walking with Bella" (10:15 - 12:15) and "Yoga class with Emily" (13:37 - 15:07) do not overlap with any other events, so they can both be included.
7. I'll construct the schedule with these events in chronological order.
