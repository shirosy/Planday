To create an optimized schedule based on the given events, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and their weights.
2. Arrange all events in chronological order.
3. Ensure no overlaps occur and prioritize events with higher weights in case of conflicts.
4. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Priority Events:
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (Weight = 2)
- Marketing standup on Zoom (Weight = 2)

Non-Priority Events:
- One-on-one with manager (Weight = 1)
- Analyzing product performance (Weight = 1)
- Preparing PTO handover (Weight = 1)
- Meeting with Lisa at café (Weight = 1)
- Replying to emails (Weight = 1)

Ch Chronological Order:
1. Marketing standup on Zoom (02:08 - 02:23)
2. One-on-one with manager (04:30 - 05:45)
3. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (07:44 - 09:44)
4. Analyzing product performance (11:08 - 13:08)
5. Preparing PTO handover (14:20 - 16:20)
6. Meeting with Lisa at café (17:44 - 19:14)
7. Replying to emails (18:05 - 20:05)

Now, let's arrange the schedule while respecting the priorities and avoiding overlaps:
