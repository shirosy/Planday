To create the optimized schedule, we need to follow these steps:

1. **List the events with their start and end times:**
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:15 - 03:30, weight = 2)
   - Watching 'Inception' (02:51 - 04:21, weight = 1)
   - Yoga class with Emily (04:20 - 06:20, weight = 1)
   - Calling Mom and Dad (06:45 - 07:30, weight = 1)
   - Walking with Bella (20:07 - 21:37, weight = 1)

2. **Sort the events in chronological order:**
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:15 - 03:30)
   - Watching 'Inception' (02:51 - 04:21)
   - Yoga class with Emily (04:20 - 06:20)
   - Calling Mom and Dad (06:45 - 07:30)
   - Walking with Bella (20:07 - 21:37)

3. **Check for conflicts and resolve them by including the event with the higher weighted time:**
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (02:15 - 03:30) and Watching 'Inception' (02:51 - 04:21) overlap. 
     - Weighted time for Deep cleaning: 1 hour 15 minutes (75 minutes)
     - Weighted time for Watching 'Inception': 1 hour 30 minutes (90 minutes)
     - Include Watching 'Inception' as it has the higher weighted time.
   - The rest of the events do not overlap.

4. **Create the final schedule:**
   - Include all non-overlapping events and the event with the higher weighted time in case of overlap.
