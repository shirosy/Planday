To create an optimized schedule based on the given events and rules, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the priority events and non-priority events.
2. Arrange all events in chronological order.
3. Check for overlaps and conflicts.
4. Resolve conflicts using the priority rule.
5. Ensure no overlaps and maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Here's the breakdown of events:

- AI keynote (priority, weight = 2, start = 06:18, end = 07:03)
- Web3 panel discussion (weight = 1, start = 01:15, end = 02:00)
- Trying new VR headset (weight = 1, start = 01:40, end = 02:10)
- Async Python talk (weight = 1, start = 05:30, end = 06:45)
- Networking with engineers (weight = 1, start = 20:35, end = 21:50)

When arranged chronologically:
1. Web3 panel discussion (01:15 - 02:00)
2. Trying new VR headset (01:40 - 02:10) - overlaps with Web3 panel discussion
3. Async Python talk (05:30 - 06:45)
4. AI keynote (priority) (06:18 - 07:03) - overlaps with Async Python talk
5. Networking with engineers (20:35 - 21:50)

Next, I'll resolve conflicts:
- Trying new VR headset overlaps with Web3 panel discussion. Since both have the same weight, I'll exclude the one that starts later, which is Trying new VR headset.
- AI keynote overlaps with Async Python talk. Since AI keynote has higher weight (priority), I'll include AI keynote and exclude Async Python talk.

Final schedule:
