Let's analyze the events and their priorities:

1. **Chemistry experiment (priority)**: 15:28 - 17:13
2. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (priority)**: 08:03 - 09:48
3. **Meeting with Emma and Jake (priority)**: 16:41 - 17:41
4. **Chess with Daniel**: 05:34 - 06:49
5. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams**: 05:45 - 06:30
6. **Researching in library**: 08:28 - 09:13
7. **Group study for physics test**: 10:38 - 11:53
8. **Office hours with Prof. Chen**: 19:36 - 19:51

Since we have three priority events, we need to ensure they fit into the schedule without overlap. Let's start by placing the highest priority events and then fit the remaining events where possible without violating the rules.

- **Chemistry experiment** (15:28 - 17:13)
- **Study session with Sarah and Mike** (08:03 - 09:48)
- **Meeting with Emma and Jake** (16:41 - 17:41)

Now, let's check for conflicts and fit in the remaining events:

- **Chess with Daniel** (05:34 - 06:49) does not overlap with any other events.
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams** (05:45 - 06:30) does not overlap with any other events.
- **Researching in library** (08:28 - 09:13) conflicts with the Study session with Sarah and Mike, which has priority.
- **Group study for physics test** (10:38 - 11:53) does not overlap with any other events.
- **Office hours with Prof. Chen** (19:36 - 19:51) does not overlap with any other events.

We will exclude the Researching in library event due to the priority of Study session with Sarah and Mike.
