1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - **Backstage tour VIP pass:** (03:05 - 03:50, weight 1)
   - **David Guetta DJ set:** (03:15 - 03:30, weight 1)
   - **Fireworks:** (10:30 - 11:30, weight 2)
   - **David Bowie tribute concert:** (15:42 - 16:12, weight 1)

2. **Chronological Ordering:**
   - Events must be arranged strictly in chronological order based on their start times:
     1. Backstage tour VIP pass (03:05 - 03:50)
     2. David Guetta DJ set (03:15 - 03:30)
     3. Fireworks (10:30 - 11:30)
     4. David Bowie tribute concert (15:42 - 16:12)

3. **Chronological Order Verification:**
   - No overlap or conflicts are present in chronological order.
   - Priority events are respected as they are already excluded by the chronological order requirement.

4. **Finalized Schedule:**
   - Since all events are compatible with each other in terms of chronological order and no events need to be excluded, all should be included in the schedule.
