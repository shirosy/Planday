1. First, let's review all the given events and their time slots.
2. Identify priority events. In this case, the Quantum computing guest talk is the priority event.
3. Ensure that the priority event is included in the schedule as it is, without any changes to its start or end time.
4. Check for conflicts and overlaps with other events, and resolve them by choosing the event with the higher weighted time.
5. Since the Quantum computing guest talk overlaps with the Structural Dynamics lecture, we need to exclude one of them.
6. Calculate the weighted durations: 
   - Meeting with Emma and Jake: 1 hour 59 minutes = 119 minutes, weight 1
   - Quantum computing guest talk: 1 hour 30 minutes = 90 minutes, weight 2
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike: 30 minutes, weight 1
   - Chess with Daniel: 45 minutes, weight 1
   - Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams: 45 minutes, weight 1
   - Structural Dynamics lecture: 45 minutes, weight 1
7. The Quantum computing guest talk, with a higher weighted time, will be included, and the Structural Dynamics lecture will be excluded.
8. The final schedule should include the Quantum computing guest talk and the other non-conflicting events in chronological order.
