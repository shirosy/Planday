To create an optimized schedule based on the given events and rules, I'll follow these steps:
1. Sort events by their start times.
2. Assign weights to events based on their priority.
3. Resolve any conflicts by choosing the event with the higher weighted duration.
4. Ensure chronological order and no overlaps.
5. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations.

Here's the sorted list of events by start time:
1. Digital detox meditation session (01:01 - 02:01)
2. AI keynote (00:12 - 01:57)
3. Live coding on Rust (02:58 - 03:58)
4. Trying new VR headset (05:51 - 07:36)
5. 3D printing workshop (07:57 - 09:57)
6. Web3 panel discussion (19:20 - 20:05)
7. Drone building hackathon (19:46 - 21:16)
8. Small Language Models talk (21:50 - 22:05)

Next, I'll assign weights:
- Normal events: weight = 1
- Priority events (3D printing workshop): weight = 2

Now, I'll proceed to resolve conflicts and create the schedule.
