Let's go through the events and their priorities step-by-step to create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without overlaps.

1. **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:41 - 04:11)** - Normal event
2. **One-on-one with manager (04:59 - 06:14)** - Normal event
3. **Client call with Acme Corp (09:15 - 10:30)** - Normal event
4. **Preparing PTO handover (16:21 - 17:21)** - Normal event
5. **Q1 revenue report writing (19:34 - 21:19)** - Normal event
6. **Meeting with Lisa at café (20:04 - 21:04)** - Priority event

Next, we need to check for overlaps and conflicts between events.

- The **Marketing standup on Zoom (02:41 - 04:11)** does not overlap with any other event.
- The **One-on-one with manager (04:59 - 06:14)** does not overlap with any other event.
- The **Client call with Acme Corp (09:15 - 10:30)** does not overlap with any other event.
- The **Preparing PTO handover (16:21 - 17:21)** does not overlap with any other event.
- The **Q1 revenue report writing (19:34 - 21:19)** does not overlap with any other event.
- The **Meeting with Lisa at café (20:04 - 21:04)** overlaps with the **Q1 revenue report writing (19:34 - 21:19)**.

Since the **Meeting with Lisa at café** is a priority event, we will include it in the schedule and exclude the overlapping **Q1 revenue report writing**.
