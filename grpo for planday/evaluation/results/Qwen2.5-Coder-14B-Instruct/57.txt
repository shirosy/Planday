1. First, I'll list all events in chronological order:
   - Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13)
   - Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24)
   - Cooking pasta (10:15 - 10:45)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (15:29 - 15:59)
   - Walking with Bella (15:41 - 17:41)
   - Shopping at farmer's market (20:48 - 22:33)

2. The priority event (Yoga class with Emily) is already at the correct position since its start time is earlier than other overlapping events.

3. There is an overlap between Jogging at the park (01:09 - 02:24) and Yoga class with Emily (01:13 - 02:13). Since Yoga class has higher weight, it will be included in the schedule, and jogging will be excluded.

4. The remaining events do not overlap, so they can all be included in the schedule.
