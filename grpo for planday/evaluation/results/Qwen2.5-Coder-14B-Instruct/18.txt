Let's reason through this step by step to create an optimized schedule:

1. **Identify Priority Events**:
   - Analyzing product performance is a priority event (weight = 2).

2. **Order Events Chronologically**:
   - 02:30 - 04:15: One-on-one with manager
   - 04:03 - 04:48: Replying to emails
   - 12:29 - 14:14: Meeting with Lisa at café
   - 13:41 - 14:41: Analyzing product performance (priority event)
   - 18:46 - 20:01: Preparing PTO handover

3. **Check for Overlaps**:
   - There's a conflict between the Meeting with Lisa at café (13:41 - 14:41) and the One-on-one with manager (12:30 - 04:15), but since the latter ends before the lunch meeting starts, they do not overlap.
   - The Meeting with Lisa at café and Analyzing product performance overlap (13:41 - 14:41). Since Analyzing product performance has a higher weight, the meeting should be excluded.

4. **Optimize Schedule**:
   - Include all events respect chronological order, avoiding overlaps, prioritizing by weight.
