1. **Event Weights and Durations**:
   - Drone building hackathon: 45 minutes (weight = 1)
   - Web3 panel discussion: 30 minutes (weight = 1)
   - Live coding on Rust: 130 minutes (weight = 1)
   - Networking with engineers: 190 minutes (weight = 2)
   - Trying new VR headset: 115 minutes (weight = 2)

2. **Chronological Order**:
   - Drone building hackathon (10:02 - 10:47)
   - Web3 panel discussion (16:03 - 16:33)
   - Live coding on Rust (17:22 - 18:52)
   - Networking with engineers (19:56 - 21:56)
   - Trying new VR headset (21:29 - 22:44)

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - The networking with engineers event (19:56 - 21:56) conflicts with trying new VR headset (21:29 - 22:44).
   - Since Networking with engineers has a higher weight (2) compared to Trying new VR headset (2), we prioritize Networking with engineers and exclude Trying new VR headset.

4. **Final Schedule**:
   - We include all other events without any conflicts since they do not overlap with each other.
