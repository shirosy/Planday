Let's go through the events and place them in chronological order while respecting the priorities and rule of no overlap:
1. One-on-one with manager (00:37 - 02:07)
2. Preparing PTO handover (01:20 - 03:20) (Priority event)
3. Marketing standup on Zoom (03:27 - 03:42)
4. Q1 revenue report writing (04:41 - 05:26)
5. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (17:58 - 18:28)
6. Analyzing product performance (21:05 - 21:50) (Priority event)

The presence of "Preparing PTO handover" (priority event) conflicts with "One-on-one with manager" (01:20 - 03:20), but "Preparing PTO handover" has higher priority and will be included. The "One-on-one with manager" will be excluded.

Analyzing product performance conflicts with Q1 revenue report writing and Q1 revenue report writing conflicts with Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick, but since "Analyzing product performance" has the highest priority, all other events in its way will be excluded.

The events will be organized as follows:
- One-on-one with manager (excluded)
- Preparing PTO handover
- Marketing standup on Zoom
- Q1 revenue report writing (excluded)
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (excluded)
- Analyzing product performance
