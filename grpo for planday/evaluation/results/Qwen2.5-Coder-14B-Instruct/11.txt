1. **Identify Priority Events**: The Quantum computing guest talk is a priority event with a weight of 2.
2. **Order Events Chronologically**: List all events in chronological order.
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: In case of overlapping events, prioritize based on weight.
4. **Exclude Non-Essential Events**: If necessary, exclude events to avoid schedule conflicts while maximizing weighted time.

**Event List (Chronological Order)**:
- Quantum computing guest talk (03:56 - 04:56)
- Office hours with Prof. Chen (07:50 - 08:35)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (11:39 - 13:09)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (13:54 - 14:39)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (13:59 - 15:29)
- Chemistry experiment (17:15 - 17:45)
- Researching in library (20:39 - 21:39)

**Conflict Resolution**:
- The study session with Sarah and Mike conflicts with the Structural Dynamics lecture. Since both are non-priority events, exclude the one with the shorter duration, which is the study session with Sarah and Mike.
- There are no further conflicts with priority events.

**Final Schedule**:
- Include all events in the chronological order, excluding the conflicting non-priority event.
