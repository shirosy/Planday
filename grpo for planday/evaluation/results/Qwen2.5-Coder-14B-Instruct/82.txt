1. The priority events are the AI keynote and the Drone building hackathon. These must be included in the schedule regardless of time conflicts, as they have a higher weight.
2. The AI keynote starts at 03:20 and ends at 05:20.
3. The Drone building hackathon starts at 19:32 and ends at 21:17.
4. We need to check for overlaps between other events and these two priority events. If there are overlaps, we should exclude the lower priority event.
5. Starting from the AI keynote, we can fit in the Small Language Models talk (10:43 - 12:43) and the Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41) without any conflicts.
6. For the 3D printing workshop (16:57 - 18:27), it overlaps with the Networking with engineers (16:41 - 17:41), so we exclude it.
7. The Live coding on Rust (18:50 - 19:20) does not conflict with anything else.
8. The Trying new VR headset (21:23 - 21:38) conflicts with the Drone building hackathon (19:32 - 21:17), so we exclude it.
