Let's first review the events and their priorities:

1. **Jogging at the park (03:34 - 05:19) - Priority Event (weight=2)**
2. **Deep cleaning the kitchen (03:39 - 05:39)**
3. **Cooking pasta (12:06 - 12:21)**
4. **Shopping at farmer's market (15:55 - 17:40)**

We need to ensure that priority events are placed first if their start times are earlier. In this case, "Jogging at the park" starts earlier and is a priority event, so it should be included first. 

Next, we look at the remaining events and check for conflicts:
- "Deep cleaning the kitchen" starts at 03:39, overlaps with "Jogging at the park," and has the same start time but ends later. Since "Jogging at the park" is a priority event, "Deep cleaning the kitchen" is excluded.
- "Cooking pasta" and "Shopping at farmer's market" do not overlap with each other or with the already included "Jogging at the park."

The schedule should be:
1. "Jogging at the park" (03:34 - 05:19)
2. "Cooking pasta" (12:06 - 12:21)
3. "Shopping at farmer's market" (15:55 - 17:40)

This schedule respects the chronological order, avoids overlaps, and includes the priority event first.
