I'll first list the events in chronological order and note the priorities. 

1. Marketing standup on Zoom (06:24 - 06:39) - Normal event
2. Replying to emails (13:52 - 15:37) - Normal event
3. Preparing PTO handover (14:18 - 15:48) - Priority event
4. Meeting with Lisa at café (16:57 - 18:57) - Normal event

Since the preparing PTO handover event is a priority and its time conflicts with the emails event, I'll exclude the emails event to avoid overlap and maximize the weighted duration.

Final schedule will include:
- Marketing standup on Zoom
- Preparing PTO handover
- Meeting with Lisa at café
