1. First, we identify the priority events: Chess with Daniel and Office hours with Prof. Chen.
2. Both priority events can be scheduled without overlap.
3. Next, we consider the remaining events and try to fit them into the schedule.
4. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams and Structural Dynamics lecture have a conflict at 08:39, but we should choose the event that gives more weight.
5. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight = 2) starts at 08:20 and ends at 10:05.
6. Structural Dynamics lecture (weight = 1) starts at 08:39 and ends at 08:54.
7. Study session with Sarah and Mike starts at 11:30 and ends at 11:45.
8. Quantum computing guest talk starts at 14:01 and ends at 14:16.
9. Researching in library starts at 19:40 and ends at 19:55.
