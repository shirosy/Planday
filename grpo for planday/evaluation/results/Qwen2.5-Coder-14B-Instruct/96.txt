First, I will list out all the events with their start and end times and their respective weights. Then, I will check for overlaps and prioritize the events based on their weights.

1. 3D printing workshop (04:39 - 05:09, weight = 2)
2. Drone building hackathon (05:50 - 07:20, weight = 1)
3. Live coding on Rust (20:36 - 21:21, weight = 1)
4. Digital detox meditation session (20:52 - 21:37, weight = 1)

Let's check for overlaps:
- The 3D printing workshop (04:39 - 05:09) does not overlap with any other event.
- The Drone building hackathon (05:50 - 07:20) does not overlap with any other event.
- The Live coding on Rust (20:36 - 21:21) overlaps with the Digital detox meditation session (20:52 - 21:37).
- The Digital detox meditation session (20:52 - 21:37) overlaps with the Live coding on Rust (20:36 - 21:21).

In the overlapping times (20:52 - 21:21), the Digital detox meditation session has a higher weight (1 vs 1) so it will be considered over the Live coding on Rust.

Now, I will create the optimized schedule based on the above analysis.
