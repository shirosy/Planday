1. First, identify all events and their priorities.
2. List out all events in chronological order.
3. Check for any overlapping events and prioritize based on their weights.
4. Remove any overlapping events that do not meet the priority criteria.

Chronological order of all events:
- Group study for physics test (05:08 - 05:23)
- Quantum computing guest talk (06:57 - 07:27)
- Structural Dynamics lecture (12:31 - 14:31)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (13:08 - 13:53)
- Researching in library (14:35 - 16:20)
- Chemistry experiment (20:30 - 22:15)

Checking for overlaps:
- No direct overlaps between events.
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams and Structural Dynamics lecture overlap from 13:08 to 13:53.

Since the Group study for physics test is a priority (weight = 2) and it doesn't overlap with any other event, it should be included in the schedule.

The Structual Dynamics lecture (weight = 1) overlaps with the Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight = 1). In this case, we can exclude the Structual Dynamics lecture as it does not contribute to the weighted event durations more than the Calculus lecture.

Final schedule after adjustments:
- Group study for physics test (05:08 - 05:23)
- Quantum computing guest talk (06:57 - 07:27)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (13:08 - 13:53)
- Researching in library (14:35 - 16:20)
- Chemistry experiment (20:30 - 22:15)
