Let's analyze the events and their priorities to create the optimized schedule.

1. **Client call with Acme Corp (03:12 - 05:12)**
   - Normal event.

2. **Analyzing product performance (04:28 - 05:13)**
   - Normal event.
   - Conflicts with the client call (03:12 - 05:12).

3. **Meeting with Lisa at café (06:34 - 07:49)**
   - Normal event.

4. **Preparing PTO handover (14:32 - 15:47)**
   - Priority event.
   - Takes priority after both the client call and analyzing product performance.

5. **Q1 revenue report writing (19:05 - 20:05)**
   - Priority event.
   - Takes priority after preparing PTO handover.

Since the Q1 revenue report writing has a higher priority and a later start time, it should be included. Preparing PTO handover also has a high priority and should be included. The client call conflicts with the product performance analysis, so we will exclude the product performance analysis to maximize the weighted duration.

The optimized schedule will include:
- Client call with Acme Corp
- Meeting with Lisa at café
- Preparing PTO handover
- Q1 revenue report writing
