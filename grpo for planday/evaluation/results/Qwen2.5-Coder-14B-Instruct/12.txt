First, I will list all events in chronological order and then apply the priority rules to determine the final schedule.

1. Researching in library (02:20 - 03:20)
2. Chess with Daniel (10:47 - 11:17)
3. Quantum computing guest talk (14:57 - 16:12)
4. Group study for physics test (17:16 - 18:31)
5. Study session with Sarah and Mike (18:03 - 18:18)
6. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (19:13 - 19:43)

Next, I will apply the priority rules:
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (priority event, weight = 2)
- Researching in library (priority event, weight = 2)

Since the priority events do not overlap with each other and do not interfere with any other events, I will include both of them in the schedule. All other events will be included as they do not conflict with each other or the priority events.
