1. Chronologically order the events based on their start times.
2. Identify priority events (Drone building hackathon) and ensure they are placed correctly without overlaps.
3. In case of conflicts, prioritize the event with the higher weighted time (priority events have weight = 2, normal events have weight = 1).
4. Exclude any events that cause conflicts and result in a lower sum of weighted event durations.
