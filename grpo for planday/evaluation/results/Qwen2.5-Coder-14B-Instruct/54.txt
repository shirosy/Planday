1. **Researching in library (09:35 - 11:05)**: Normal event.
2. **Group study for physics test (10:41 - 10:56)**: Normal event, overlaps with "Researching in library". Since the group study is shorter, it can be excluded to make room for the library research.
3. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (12:39 - 13:24)**: Priority event.
4. **Study session with Sarah and Mike (12:55 - 13:40)**: Normal event, overlaps with "Office hours with Prof. Chen". Since the office hours are more priority, this event can be excluded.
5. **Structural Dynamics lecture (15:58 - 16:43)**: Normal event.
6. **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (18:06 - 19:51)**: Priority event.

Since the group study and the study session with Sarah and Mike overlap with higher-priority events, they will be excluded.
