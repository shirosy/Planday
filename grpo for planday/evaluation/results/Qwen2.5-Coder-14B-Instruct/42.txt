Let's go through the events step-by-step and apply the rules to create the optimized schedule:

1. **Digital detox meditation session (02:53 - 04:08)**: This is a normal event with a weight of 1.
2. **Drone building hackathon (03:52 - 05:52)**: This overlaps with the meditation session and has a higher weighted time (prior to AI keynote), so it will replace the meditation session.
3. **AI keynote (11:20 - 12:05)**: This is a priority event with a weight of 2 and does not overlap with any other events, so it will be included.
4. **Networking with engineers (13:31 - 14:46)**: This event does not overlap with any other events, so it will be included.

Final schedule:
- Drone building hackathon (03:52 - 05:52)
- AI keynote (11:20 - 12:05)
- Networking with engineers (13:31 - 14:46)
