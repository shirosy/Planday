1. **Identify and Organize Events**: List all events with their start and end times.
2. **Determine Priorities**: The Chemistry experiment has a higher priority.
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: 
   - Office hours (05:52 - 07:52) and structural dynamics lecture (18:40 - 20:10) are non-overlapping.
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike (21:13 - 23:13) and Chemistry experiment (21:02 - 22:02) overlap; the experiment has higher priority.
4. **Exclude Lower Prior Events**: The overlapping study session with Sarah and Mike will be excluded due to the Chemistry experiment's priority.
