First, I'll list all the events with their start and end times, noting the priorities. Then, I'll create a schedule that respects the chronological order and maximizes the weighted event durations, excluding any events that would cause overlaps or conflicts.

Events:
1. Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:02 - 00:47) - Priority
2. Jogging at the park (02:00 - 03:30)
3. Walking with Bella (02:00 - 02:30)
4. Shopping at farmer's market (04:39 - 06:24)
5. Yoga class with Emily (18:30 - 20:00) - Priority

Priority events:
- Deep cleaning the kitchen
- Yoga class with Emily

Let's arrange them in chronological order and prioritize the overlap resolution:

1. Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:02 - 00:47) - No overlap, scheduled.
2. Jogging at the park (02:00 - 03:30) and Walking with Bella (02:00 - 02:30) overlap. Since both are normal events, we'll choose the one that ends sooner to maximize space.
   - Walking with Bella (02:00 - 02:30) is chosen.
3. Continue with Jogging at the park (02:30 - 03:30) after Walking with Bella.
4. Shopping at farmer's market (04:39 - 06:24) - No overlap, scheduled.
5. Yoga class with Emily (18:30 - 20:00) - No overlap, scheduled.

Final schedule:
- Deep cleaning the kitchen (00:02 - 00:47)
- Walking with Bella (02:00 - 02:30)
- Jogging at the park (02:30 - 03:30)
- Shopping at farmer's market (04:39 - 06:24)
- Yoga class with Emily (18:30 - 20:00)
