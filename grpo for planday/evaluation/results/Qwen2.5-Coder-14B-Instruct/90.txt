To create an optimized schedule based on the given rules, I will follow these steps:
1. List all events with their start and end times and assign weights based on priority.
2. Sort events by their start times in chronological order.
3. Calculate the weighted duration for each event.
4. Maximize the sum of weighted event durations while ensuring no overlaps.
5. In conflicts, include the event with the higher weighted time.
6. Ensure the final schedule respects all rules and does not exclude any events unless absolutely necessary.
