Let's evaluate the given events and their priorities:

1. **Q1 revenue report writing**: 00:19 - 00:34 (Normal event, weight = 1)
2. **Client call with Acme Corp**: 15:43 - 17:13 (Priority event, weight = 2)
3. **Updating website content**: 20:54 - 21:24 (Normal event, weight = 1)
4. **Analyzing product performance**: 21:04 - 21:34 (Normal event, weight = 1)

The priority event is the client call with Acme Corp. This event must be included and can't be excluded or altered.

Next, let's check for any overlapping events:
- Q1 revenue report writing (00:19 - 00:34) and Client call with Acme Corp (15:43 - 17:13) do not overlap.
- Client call with Acme Corp (15:43 - 17:13), Updating website content (20:54 - 21:24), and Analyzing product performance (21:04 - 21:34) do not overlap.

Since there are no overlaps and all events can be included without conflicts, we will include all events in the schedule.
