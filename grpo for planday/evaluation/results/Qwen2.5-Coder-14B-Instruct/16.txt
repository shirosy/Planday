Let's reason through the scheduling of these events based on the given rules:

1. **Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (01:34 - 03:19)**
   - No conflicts, so it can be scheduled first.

2. **Q1 revenue report writing (01:47 - 02:32)**
   - This event overlaps with Brainstorming and finishes earlier. Since its duration is shorter, it will be excluded to maximize weighted duration.

3. **Marketing standup on Zoom (09:38 - 10:53)**
   - This is a priority event. It doesn't overlap with any other events, so it can be scheduled next.

4. **Client call with Acme Corp (14:12 - 15:42)**
   - This event overlaps with One-on-one with manager, which starts at the same time but finishes a minute later. Since Client call has a higher weighted time (since it is a priority event), it will be scheduled instead of One-on-one with manager.

5. **One-on-one with manager (14:13 - 15:43)**
   - This event conflicts with Client call with Acme Corp. Since Client call has a higher weighted time, it will be excluded.

6. **Preparing PTO handover (19:30 - 21:00)**
   - No conflicts, so it can be scheduled last.
