1. First, I'll list out all the events with their start and end times along with their priorities.
2. I'll then sort the events chronologically.
3. I'll check for any overlapping events and resolve conflicts by keeping the event with the higher weighted time.
4. Finally, I'll ensure that the schedule is strictly chronological and follows all the given rules.

Events:
1. One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45, priority = 1)
2. Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42, priority = 1)
3. Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37, priority = 2)
4. Preparing PTO handover (20:32 - 20:47, priority = 1)

Chronological order:
1. One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45)
2. Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42)
3. Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37)
4. Preparing PTO handover (20:32 - 20:47) - This event overlaps with the client call, so we need to resolve the conflict.

Conflict resolution:
- The client call with Acme Corp has a higher priority (weight = 2) compared to Preparing PTO handover (weight = 1). Therefore, we will keep the client call and exclude Preparing PTO handover.

Final schedule:
1. One-on-one with manager (16:30 - 16:45)
2. Meeting with Lisa at café (19:27 - 19:42)
3. Client call with Acme Corp (20:22 - 20:37)
