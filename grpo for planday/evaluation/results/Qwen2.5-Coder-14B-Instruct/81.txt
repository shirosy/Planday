Let's reason through the scheduling requirements step-by-step.

1. **Identify Priority Events**: The only priority event is "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams" which runs from 12:58 to 14:43. This event cannot be split or shortened, and must be included in the schedule.
2. **Analyze Non-Priority Events**: We have three non-priority events:
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen: 02:13 - 03:58
   - Chess with Daniel: 03:24 - 04:54
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike: 07:49 - 08:19
3. **Check for Overlaps**:
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen and Chess with Daniel overlap from 03:24 to 03:58.
   - None of the non-priority events overlap with the priority event "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams".
4. **Determine Inclusion**: Since the priority event "Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams" cannot be removed, we need to decide which of the overlapping non-priority events to include. The inclusion of one event will exclude the other.
5. **Calculate Weighted Durations**:
   - Office hours with Prof. Chen: Duration = 1 hour 45 minutes (105 minutes), Weighted Duration = 1 * 105 = 105
   - Chess with Daniel: Duration = 1 hour 30 minutes (90 minutes), Weighted Duration = 1 * 90 = 90
   - Study session with Sarah and Mike: Duration = 30 minutes, Weighted Duration = 1 * 30 = 30
6. **Maximize Weighted Duration**: The office hours with Prof. Chen provide a higher weighted duration compared to Chess with Daniel (105 vs 90).

Given these considerations, we should include only "Office hours with Prof. Chen" among the non-priority events.
