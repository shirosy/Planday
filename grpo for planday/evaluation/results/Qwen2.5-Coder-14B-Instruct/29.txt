1. **Identify Priority Events**: 
   - "Calling Mom and Dad" (priority weight = 2)
   - "Reading 'Dune'" (priority weight = 2)

2. **List Non-Priority Events**: 
   - Cooking pasta (02:02 - 03:02)
   - Yoga class with Emily (08:12 - 08:57)
   - Walking with Bella (15:57 - 17:12)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (18:55 - 19:40)

3. **Check for Overlaps and Conflicts**:
   - No direct conflicts with priority events, so we can consider their total duration and weights.
   - "Planting flowers in the garden" (18:55 - 19:40) conflicts with "Calling Mom and Dad" (17:35 - 19:35). Since both have equal priority but "Calling Mom and Dad" starts earlier and covers the whole duration, "Planting flowers in the garden" must be excluded.

4. **Optimize Schedule**:
   - Since "Planting flowers in the garden" is excluded, we don't need to make any further adjustments to the remaining events as they don't overlap with each other or priority events.

5. **Final Check**:
   - Ensure all events are in strict chronological order.
   - Verify that no overlaps occur with priority events.
