The farmer's market event has the highest priority, so it must be included first. There are no overlaps with this event, so we can include all other events as they do not conflict in terms of time.

1. Shopping at farmer's market (00:04 - 02:04) - Priority event
2. Cooking pasta (08:47 - 10:02) - Normal event
3. Planting flowers in the garden (20:17 - 21:32) - Normal event
4. Yoga class with Emily (20:32 - 21:02) - Normal event

The only potential overlap is between planting flowers and the yoga class, but the yoga class ends before planting flowers starts, so there is no conflict.

All events can be scheduled without any issues, and the order respects the chronological start times and priorities.
