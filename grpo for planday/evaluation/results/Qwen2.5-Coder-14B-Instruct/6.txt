1. **Identify Priority Events**: 
   - 'Reading 'Dune'' (Priority = 2, Duration = 30 minutes)
   - 'Walking with Bella' (Priority = 2, Duration = 45 minutes)

2. **Identify Normal Events**:
   - Shopping at farmer's market (Priority = 1, Duration = 80 minutes)
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen (Priority = 1, Duration = 45 minutes)
   - Jogging at the park (Priority = 1, Duration = 30 minutes)
   - Planting flowers in the garden (Priority = 1, Duration = 2 hours 1 minute)

3. **Prioritize Overlaps**:
   - 'Walking with Bella' (08:22 - 09:07) and 'Deep cleaning the kitchen' (15:48 - 16:33) do not overlap.
   - 'Jogging at the park' (16:21 - 16:51) and 'Deep cleaning the kitchen' (15:48 - 16:33) overlap, but 'Jogging at the park' has lower priority.

4. **Schedule Planning**:
   - Include 'Reading 'Dune'' and 'Walking with Bella'' because they are both priority events.
   - Include 'Shopping at farmer's market', 'Deep cleaning the kitchen', and 'Planting flowers in the garden' as they do not conflict with each other.
   - Exclude 'Jogging at the park' due to overlap with 'Deep cleaning the kitchen' and lower priority.

5. **Final Check**:
   - Ensure all events are in strict chronological order.
   - Ensure no overlaps and higher priority events are included.
