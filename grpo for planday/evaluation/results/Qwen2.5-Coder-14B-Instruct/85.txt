Let's start by listing the events in chronological order and marking the priority event.

1. Walking with Bella (00:59 - 02:59)
2. Shopping at farmer's market (02:34 - 03:34)
3. Calling Mom and Dad (06:59 - 07:44)
4. Jogging at the park (07:50 - 09:05)
5. Yoga class with Emily (10:11 - 11:11) - priority event
6. Watching 'Inception' (12:19 - 14:19)

First, we identify that there are no overlapping events, so all events can potentially be scheduled chronologically without adjustments. 

Since there are no overlaps and no conflicts, the priority event (Yoga class with Emily) will naturally be included without needing to conflict resolution or exclusion. 

The schedule respects the chronological order, and all events are included because there are no conflicts.
