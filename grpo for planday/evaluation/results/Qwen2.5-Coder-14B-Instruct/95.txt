1. First, I will list all the events and their priorities for clarity.
2. The priority events are the Sum 41 concert (Weight = 2) and the Silent disco party (Weight = 2).
3. The normal events are the David Guetta DJ set (Weight = 1), David Bowie tribute concert (Weight = 1), and Avril Lavigne concert (Weight = 1).
4. The events need to be arranged in chronological order, and I will ensure that no overlaps occur.
5. I will include the highest weighted event in case of any overlaps.
6. I will calculate the total weighted duration of the included events to maximize the sum.
