1. **Identify the start and end times of all events:**
   - Q1 revenue report writing: 00:29 - 02:29
   - Replying to emails: 01:37 - 03:22
   - Client call with Acme Corp: 03:35 - 04:20
   - Preparing PTO handover: 03:57 - 05:27
   - One-on-one with manager: 12:01 - 13:46
   - Analyzing product performance: 19:01 - 21:01

2. **Assign weights based on priority:**
   - Preparing PTO handover (weight = 2)
   - Replying to emails (weight = 2)
   - Other events (weight = 1)

3. **Check for overlaps and order by start time:**
   - Q1 revenue report writing (00:29 - 02:29)
   - Replying to emails (01:37 - 03:22)
   - Preparing PTO handover (03:57 - 05:27)
   - Client call with Acme Corp (03:35 - 04:20) (overlaps with Preparing PTO handover but has lower weight)
   - One-on-one with manager (12:01 - 13:46)
   - Analyzing product performance (19:01 - 21:01)

4. **Resolve conflicts by including the event with the higher weighted time:**
   - Replying to emails and Preparing PTO handover both overlap with Client call with Acme Corp, but since Preparing PTO handover has a higher weight, it should take priority.

5. **Determine the final schedule:**
   - Q1 revenue report writing
   - Replying to emails
   - Preparing PTO handover
   - One-on-one with manager
   - Analyzing product performance
