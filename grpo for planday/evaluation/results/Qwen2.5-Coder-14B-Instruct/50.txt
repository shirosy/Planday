1. First, I need to identify the priority events and ensure they are placed in the schedule according to their start times.
2. The priority events are the "Fireworks" (08:34 - 09:34) and the "Silent disco party" (14:40 - 16:10).
3. The other events are:
   - David Guetta DJ set (17:32 - 18:17)
   - Sum 41 concert (18:10 - 18:25)
   - Korean BBQ food trucks (21:41 - 22:26)
4. I need to check for any conflicts and ensure no overlaps occur.
5. Since there are no conflicts between the priority events and the other events, I can include all events in the schedule.
