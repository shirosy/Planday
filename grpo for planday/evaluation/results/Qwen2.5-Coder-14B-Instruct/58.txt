Let's examine each event and its conflicts to create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations while respecting the given rules.

1. **Web3 panel discussion (00:55 - 02:40)**
   - No conflicts so it can be included.

2. **Live coding on Rust (02:28 - 03:58)**
   - Conflicts with Web3 panel discussion.
   - Priority event (weight = 2) should be included.
   - Exclude Web3 panel discussion.

3. **Drone building hackathon (05:59 - 06:59)**
   - No conflicts with Live coding on Rust so it can be included.

4. **3D printing workshop (12:08 - 12:23)**
   - No conflicts so it can be included.

5. **Trying new VR headset (13:19 - 15:04)**
   - Priority event (weight = 2) should be included.
   - No conflicts so it can be included.

Optimized Schedule:
- Web3 panel discussion must be excluded due to conflict.
- Schedule events in strict chronological order.
- Include priority events.
