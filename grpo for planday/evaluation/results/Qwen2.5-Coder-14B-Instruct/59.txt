First, I'll identify the priority events and place them in the schedule. Then, I'll add the remaining events making sure to respect chronological order and avoid any overlaps. If there's a conflict between events, the one with the higher weighted time will be included.

Priority events are:
1. Calling Mom and Dad (11:59 - 13:44)
2. Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:57 - 16:42)

Remaining events are:
- Reading 'Dune' (01:44 - 03:29)
- Shopping at farmer's market (15:33 - 16:48)
- Planting flowers in the garden (18:30 - 20:30)
- Walking with Bella (21:40 - 23:25)

Let's start building the schedule:

1. Place the priority event "Calling Mom and Dad" (11:59 - 13:44)
2. Place the priority event "Deep cleaning the kitchen" (15:57 - 16:42)
3. Add "Reading 'Dune'" (01:44 - 03:29) before "Calling Mom and Dad"
4. Add "Planting flowers in the garden" (18:30 - 20:30) after "Deep cleaning the kitchen"
5. Add "Walking with Bella" (21:40 - 23:25) after "Planting flowers in the garden"

There's a conflict between "Shopping at farmer's market" (15:33 - 16:48) and "Deep cleaning the kitchen" (15:57 - 16:42). Since "Deep cleaning the kitchen" has a higher weight, we will exclude "Shopping at farmer's market".

Final schedule:
- Reading 'Dune' (01:44 - 03:29)
- Calling Mom and Dad (11:59 - 13:44)
- Deep cleaning the kitchen (15:57 - 16:42)
- Planting flowers in the garden (18:30 - 20:30)
- Walking with Bella (21:40 - 23:25)
