First, I need to list all events in chronological order and identify the priority events. Then, I'll check for any conflicts and resolve them by including the event with the higher weighted time. Finally, I'll make sure that no events overlap and the schedule is in strict chronological order.

Chronological Order:
1. Office hours with Prof. Chen (00:51 - 01:21)
2. Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)
3. Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)
4. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)
5. Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)
6. Group study for physics test (14:23 - 14:53)
7. Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)

Priority Events:
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (weight = 2)
- Researching in library (weight = 2)

Conflicts:
- Chess with Daniel and Office hours with Prof. Chen both start at 00:51 but end at different times. I'll include Chess with Daniel because its duration is longer by 1 hour.
- Researching in library and Group study for physics test both start at 14:18 but end at different times. I'll include Researching in library because it starts earlier and has the same weight.

Final Schedule:
1. Chess with Daniel (00:51 - 02:21)
2. Meeting with Emma and Jake (05:04 - 06:19)
3. Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (10:25 - 11:10)
4. Researching in library (14:18 - 15:18)
5. Quantum computing guest talk (21:21 - 22:21)
