Let's analyze the events and their priorities to create an optimized schedule that maximizes the sum of weighted event durations without any overlaps.

1. **Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41)** - This is a priority event (weight = 2).
2. **Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00)** - This is a priority event (weight = 2).
3. **Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21)** - This is a priority event (weight = 2).

Now let's consider the other events:
- Structural Dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21)
- Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (11:53 - 12:23)
- Meeting with Emma and Jake (12:31 - 12:46)
- Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:30 - 15:00)
- Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34)

### Conflicts and Resolution:
- **Structural Dynamics lecture (03:51 - 04:21)** and **Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00)** overlap. We need to choose the one with the higher weight. Both have the same weight (2), but the guest talk is prioritized as it is listed later in the priority list.
- **Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21)** and **Study session with Sarah and Mike (14:30 - 15:00)** overlap. We need to choose the one with the higher weight. Chess with Daniel has higher weight (2), so we include it.

Therefore, the overlap between the Structural Dynamics lecture and Quantum computing guest talk can be resolved by excluding the Structural Dynamics lecture.

### Final Schedule:
- **Office hours with Prof. Chen (08:26 - 09:41)** - Included (priority).
- **Quantum computing guest talk (04:00 - 05:00)** - Included (priority).
- **Chess with Daniel (14:36 - 15:21)** - Included (priority).

We can add the other non-overlapping events:
- **Calculus lecture with Prof. Adams (11:53 - 12:23)** - Included.
- **Meeting with Emma and Jake (12:31 - 12:46)** - Included.
- **Group study for physics test (20:04 - 21:34)** - Included.
