First, let's identify the events and their priorities:

1. Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52)
2. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52)
3. Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49)
4. Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16) - Priority
5. Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58)
6. One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49)

Since Updating website content (priority) starts at 14:46 and ends at 16:16, it overlaps with two other events:
- Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52) does not overlap.
- Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49) does not overlap.
- Analyzing product performance (16:13 - 17:58) overlaps from 16:13 to 16:16.

The priority event Updating website content must be included, so we will exclude Analyzing product performance from 16:13 to 16:16.

Now, let's list the events in chronological order, ensuring the priority event is included and no overlaps:

1. Meeting with Lisa at café (01:37 - 02:52)
2. Brainstorming with Luke and Patrick (02:37 - 03:52)
3. Q1 revenue report writing (09:19 - 09:49)
4. Updating website content (14:46 - 16:16)
5. Analyzing product performance (16:16 - 17:58)
6. One-on-one with manager (21:19 - 21:49)
