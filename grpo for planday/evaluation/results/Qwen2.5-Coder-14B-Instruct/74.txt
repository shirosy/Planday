1. **Identify Priority Events:** Yoga class with Emily is a priority event (weight = 2).
2. **Find Conflicts:** 
   - Yoga class overlaps with Shopping at farmer's market.
3. **Resolve Conflicts:** Since Yoga class has a higher weight, it should be prioritized over Shopping at farmer's market.
4. **Check for Additional Conflicts:** 
   - No other conflicts are identified.
5. **Optimize Event Order:** 
   - Planting flowers in the garden starts before any other events.
   - Deep cleaning the kitchen comes next.
   - Calling Mom and Dad follows.
   - Yoga class with Emily is scheduled, conflicting with Shopping at the farmer's market, but is prioritized.
6. **Exclude Unnecessary Events:** 
   - Shopping at the farmer's market is excluded due to the conflict with the priority event.
