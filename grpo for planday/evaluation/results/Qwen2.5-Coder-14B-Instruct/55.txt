To create the optimal schedule, I first list all the events in chronological order, considering the absolute start and end times. I then factor in the priorities given, ensuring they are included if possible without conflicts.

Here’s the chronological order of events:
1. Fireworks (02:00 - 03:00)
2. Backstage tour VIP pass (10:01 - 11:01)
3. Sum 41 concert (15:19 - 15:34)
4. Korean BBQ food trucks (15:39 - 17:09)
5. The Killers concert (16:51 - 18:51)

Next, I calculate the weighted durations:
- Fireworks: 60 minutes × 1 = 60
- Backstage tour VIP pass: 60 minutes × 2 = 120
- Sum 41 concert: 15 minutes × 2 = 30
- Korean BBQ food trucks: 90 minutes × 1 = 90
- The Killers concert: 120 minutes × 1 = 120

The sum of weighted durations is 60 + 120 + 30 + 90 + 120 = 420.

Since there are no overlaps between events, all events can be scheduled in chronological order, respecting their priorities and durations.
